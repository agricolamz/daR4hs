Both brass coins (possibly including coins of Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Faustina) and minimi were found in 1869 and have been assumed to be part of one and the same hoard. The three accounts of the range of the first brass gave either Severus Alexander, Gallienus or Maximian as the last emperor represented, and it is now impossible to be certain which account is correct. In 1935, C.H.V. Sutherland examined 105 radiate minims from this hoard. These proved to be exactly similar to the 317 radiate minims which were acquired by Sir Arthur Evans at Bristol some years before, along with 6 regular antoniniani (NC, 1934, 92-103) [no. 804]. Dr. Sutherland therefore concluded that these 317 and 105 radiate minims all came from the Whitchurch hoard. The 6 regular antoniniani may or may not have come from the same find. They were of Victorinus (3) and Tetricus II (3). With the 317 minims, were a rough lump of copper and a piece of sheet metal. The 422 minims copied the following prototypes: Gallic Empire types (249), types of Claudius II (23), miscellaneous types (150). The large brass may have been collected together, to be melted down to make into radiate minims.",Somerset County Museum (part),III century
