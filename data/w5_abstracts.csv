Leeper,Generalizing the Taylor Principle,2007,The American Economic Review,"The paper generalizes the Taylor principle—the proposition that central banks can stabilize the macroeconomy by raising their interest rate instrument more than one-for-one in response to higher inflation—to an environment in which reaction coefficients in the monetary policy rule change regime, evolving according to a Markov process. We derive a long-run Taylor principle which delivers unique bounded equilibria in two standard models. Policy can satisfy the Taylor principle in the long run, even while deviating from it substantially for brief periods or modestly for prolonged periods. Macroeconomic volatility can be higher in periods when the Taylor principle is not satisfied, not because of indeterminacy, but because monetary policy amplifies the impacts of fundamental shocks. Regime change alters the qualitative and quantitative predictions of a conventional new Keynesian model, yielding fresh interpretations of existing empirical work. (JEL E31, E43, E52)",economics

The shadow price of a productive good is equal to its money price less its marginal product. As more of the good is consumed, its shadow price rises because of diminishing productivity, and the consumer's full income also rises because the marginal product is positive. This paper uses a simple method to derive the comparative statics of the demand system when shadow prices and full income are endogenous. The direction of the overall bias induced by endogenous prices and income is found to be determinate. We demonstrate that the demand for productive goods tends to be relatively unresponsive to exogenous changes in prices and income. We also show that labor supply will be relatively unresponsive to wage and unearned income if market work causes fatigue.",economics

The Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prevented foreign creditors from obtaining payment in the federal courts. Moreover, because the defaulting states were part of a large and economically integrated nation, creditors could not enforce payment by imposing military or trade sanctions.

In 2004, Medicare began to risk-adjust capitation payments to private Medicare Advantage (MA) plans to reduce selection-driven overpayments. But because the variance of medical costs increases with the predicted mean, incentivizing enrollment of individuals with higher scores can increase the scope for enrolling “overpriced” individuals with costs significantly below the formula's prediction. Indeed, after risk adjustment, MA plans enrolled individuals with higher scores but lower costs conditional on their score. We find no evidence that overpayments were on net reduced.

A buyer and a seller trade a divisible good. The seller is privately informed about its quality, which can be high or low. Gains from trade are positive and decreasing in quantity. The buyer makes offers over time. Divisibility introduces a new channel of competition between the buyer’s present and future selves. The buyer’s temptation to split the purchases of the high-quality good is detrimental to him. As bargaining frictions vanish and the good becomes arbitrarily divisible, the high-quality good is traded smoothly over time and the buyer’s payoff shrinks to zero. (JEL C78, D82, L15)",economics

https://openalex.org/W1515033851,John L. Newman,Economic analyses of the spacing of births.,2016,The American Economic Review,"In the last several years, economists and demographers have been increasingly interested in the spacing of births. This interest has arisen partly because younger women are often observed to play an important role in the decline of fertility in a population. Their behavior cannot be analyzed adequately within a static model of completed family size, because they cannot be assumed to have completed their fertility. The observations on these young women are censored by the survey date and reflect decisions on the spacing of births as well as the desired number of births. Thus, even if one had no interest in the spacing of births, per se, an analysis of spacing is necessary to detect whether or not changes in fertility behavior at younger ages will be reflected some years later in completed family size. The spacing of births can be interesting for its own sake. From an empirical standpoint, spacing can affect the rate of growth of a population through its effect on the average time between generations. There is also some evidence that the spacing affects the health of the child in its early years. Moreover, one might expect that as the variance of completed family size decreases in developed countries, many of the behavioral responses to socioeconomic conditions may come in the timing of births. The effort spent on developing dynamic models of fertility can also be justified on theoretical grounds because some questions cannot be handled within a static framework. How the effect of explanatory variables on fertility changes at different ages and how the spacing decision interacts with female labor force participation are two important questions which come readily to mind.",economics

This implies that the appropriate suppliers of local public goods are metropolitan governments which finance them through user charges and land rent.

Since stock returns themselves are highly volatile, any examination of what drives correlations needs to focus on long runs of data. This is particularly true since some of the short-term changes in co-movements appear to reverse themselves (Delroy Hunter 2005). We argue that changes in the co-movement of indices have not been random. Rather, they are mainly driven by greater freedom to move funds from one country to another. In related work, Geert Bekaert and Campbell Harvey (2000) show that equity correlations increase after liberalization of capital markets, using a number of case studies from emerging countries. We examine this pattern systematically for the last century, and find it to be most pronounced in the recent past. We compare the importance of capital account openness with one main alternative explanation, the growing synchronization of economic fundamentals. We conclude that greater openness has been the single most important cause of growing correlations during the last quarter of a century, though increasingly correlated economic fundamentals also matter. In the conclusion, we offer some thoughts on why the effects of greater openness appear to be so much stronger today than they were during the last era of globalization before 1914.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)",economics

Individuals would receive a subsidy to purchase insurance that was tied to the lowest-cost plan (or some index of low-cost plans) and would pay some part of the difference if they chose a more expensive plan.

Specifically, our purpose is to summarize the implications for the conduct of macroeconomic policies in open economies of both the traditional approach to open economy macroeconomics (as developed largely by James Meade, Robert Mundell, and J.

Our discussion is organized around three key linkages between national economies: through commodity trade; through capital mobility; and through exchange of national monies. These linkages have important implications concerning the effects of macroeconomic policies in open economies that differ from the effects of such policies in closed economies. Recent developments in the theory of macroeconomic policy have established conditions for the effectiveness of policies in influencing output and employment which emphasize the distinction between anticipated and unanticipated policy actions, the importance of incomplete information, and the consequences of contracts that fix nominal wages and prices over finite intervals. In this paper, we shall not analyze how these conditions are modified in an open economy.

These potential transactions involve offers that are rejected. After an initial phase in which many offers can be proffered in parallel, subsequent potential transactions must be processed serially, since a new offer cannot be made until an outstanding offer is rejected. In many, perhaps most, decentralized labor markets, this means that transactions have to be finalized before there is time for the market to clear, that is, before all the potential transactions that would need to be evaluated in order to reach a stable outcome can in fact be evaluated. This has implications for the strategic behavior of firms and workers. In particular, in deciding to whom to offer a position, a firm may have strong incentives to consider not only its preferences over workers but also the likelihood that its offer will be accepted, since if its offer is rejected it may find that many other potential employees have become unavailable in the interim. The analysis is carried out in connection with the decentralized",economics

https://openalex.org/W1490534521,Hiroya Akiba,Gains from Trade under Uncertainty: Further Comment,1980,The American Economic Review,"In an article appearing in this Review, Raveendra Batra and William Russell (hereafter B-R) analyze the effect of uncertainty in the international terms of trade on social welfare within the framework of a small country with two goods. They conclude that the expected social welfare decreases under both firstand second-degree stochastic dominance. Also in a recent issue of this Review, Richard Hartman, commenting on B-R's article, contends that (i) B-R do not allow for the change in the optimal consumption of one good, cl, as the probability distribution of the international terms of trade p undergoes a mean-preserving spread, and (ii) they do not take into account the change in cl when comparing the expected utility for different distributions of p. Based on these criticisms, Hartman presents an alternative proof to show a decrease in the expected social welfare when the distribution of p undergoes a mean-preserving spread. Batra and Russell are interested in the change of the expected social welfare when the distribution of p changes. In their model, cl is chosen before the uncertainty in p is resolved. To analyze the effect of uncertainty in p on social welfare, B-R do not allow for the change in the optimal cl under different distributions of p on the ground that cl is chosen optimally before p is known. However, as pointed out by Hartman, the optimal value of cl will be different for different distributions of p. To discuss the change in the relationship between the expected social welfare and the optimal cl, Hartman uses a diagram similar to my Figure 1. From his diagram Hartman argues that B-R's conclusion of the decrease in the expected social welfare under greater uncertainty is correct even if the optimal cl is different for different distribution of p.' In my view, B-R, as well as Hartman, only consider a special case where the expected utility curve under a probability distribution always lies above those under different probability distributions of p. If we accept Hartman's comments, I can think of another case where the expected utility curves under different probability distributions may cross. The purpose of this note is first to examine this case that could occur within the framework of the B-R analysis, but which has not been examined by B-R or Hartman. By failing to examine this case, the B-R and Hartman analyses seem incomplete. Also, by considering this case, I modify the B-R proof to show a decrease in the expected social welfare as the distribution of p undergoes a mean-preserving spread. First, Hartman's analysis of the B-R conclusion is presented. This is followed by an exami ation of the other possible situation. Finally, the modification of the proof is presented. The discussion in this note is confined to the B-R framework and their notation is used. The B-R proof simply provides a stronger sufficient condition for the decrease in the expected social welfare and does not rely on the usual comparative statics approach. In Figure 1, I denote the original equilibrium position by point 1 on the expected utility (EU) curve, I.

Individuals possess labor which they can supply as workers to a competitive labor market or use as entrepreneurs in running a firm. All entrepreneurs have access to the same risky technology and receive all profits from their firms. In the equilibrium, more risk averse individuals become workers while the less risk averse become entrepreneurs. Less risk averse entrepreneurs run larger firms and economy-wide increases in risk aversion reduce the equilibrium wage. A dynamic process of firm entry and exit is stable. The equilibrium is efficient only if all entrepreneurs are risk neutral. Inefficiencies in the number of firms and in the allocation of labor to firms are traced to inefficiencies in the risk allocation caused by institutional constraints on risk trading.

Such a negative relationship is more likely when (1) there is sufficient overlap in firms? technologies so that each firm?s inventions are likely to infringe the patents of another firm, (2) firms are sufficiently R&D intensive, and (3) patents are cheap relative to both the cost of R&D and the value of final output.

https://openalex.org/W1582254626,Tara Vishwanath,Parallel Search and Information Gathering,2016,The American Economic Review,"Many microeconomic problems fall into the following category. A decision maker has a number (n) of opportunities or projects. Each project yields an unknown reward at an uncertain time, and is characterized by an independent joint probability distribution. Once a project is selected, its reward is revealed after a random time lag when it is collected. The projects are selected sequentially in any order desired. Furthermore, at any time, a number m (1 < m < n) of projects may be explored simultaneously, that is, in parallel. The decision problem is to determine the sequential strategy for choosing the projects to maximize an objective which is a function of the rewards collected. Most of the problems in search theory, dynamic allocation problems, and many information-gathering problems fall into this class. A firm's problem of choosing technologies to develop products, job search decision of workers, price search of consumers, development of resource pools, exploration problems of mines and wells, investment decisions, and marketing strategies are but a few examples where the problem stated above is naturally applicable. Indeed, the problem is basic to many imperfect information contexts, and its analysis reveals useful insights into the nature of information acquisition and structures of markets. The motivation for the study of parallel search and information-gathering models is obvious. In problems where information acquisition is costly and time consuming, the returns to parallel effort are higher than when undertaking a single project at a time. For example, in research and development contexts, if large improvements in information are possible at low cost in early stages of development, then it becomes efficient to run several projects in parallel. In scheduling and dynamic allocation applications, where all projects must be undertaken, parallel operation substantially reduces the overall completion time. The instance of the problem when only one project can be chosen at a time (m =1) has been studied extensively in recent economic literature. In contrast, there has been no significant attempt to study parallel selection of projects. Unfortunately, the elegant results that may be derived for singleproject selection do not readily generalize to the parallel project case. Furthermore, this problem, in principle, may be formulated in a dynamic programming framework, and solved through standard techniques (such as backward induction or fixed-point methods). However, in most actual cases, this approach, besides shedding little economic insight, would be a combinatorially complex task of formidable proportions unless n and m are small. Hence, there is a need to study the effectiveness of meaningful operational rules. The purpose of this paper is to point out that simple ordering rules are obtained for the optimal parallel selection of projects, under reasonably general and meaningful conditions. These conditions may be stated in terms of risks and stochastic orderings of the distributions associated with the projects. The problem of single project selection (m = 1), falls into the general class of bandit processes (see the works of J. C. Gittens, 1979, and others), the solution for which is usually characterized by a reservation rule. Each project is assigned a reservation number or an index (analogous to internal rate of return) depending only on the features of that project and independent of all other projects. At each decision instant, the project with the highest reservation number is selected.

https://openalex.org/W1599112417,George A. Akerlof,The Short-Run Demand for Money: A New Look at an Old Problem,2016,The American Economic Review,"The purpose of this paper is to summarize the results of an earlier paper (1979), and two written in collaboration with Ross Milbourne (1980a, b) and, in so doing, to illuminate certain questions as well as answers which are implicit in the approach that has been taken. All inventory-theoretic models of the demand for money can be summarized by their assumptions about the autonomous payments into and out of bank accounts, and the way in which bank accounts are monitored. An autonomous payment is one that is independent, both in timing and amount, of the level of the bank account. From time to time holders of bank accounts monitor their accounts, at which point they either raise the level in their accounts, if deemed too low, or reduce the level in their accounts, if deemed too high. The payments made in response to this monitoring are called induced payments, in contrast to the autonomous payments. The most intuitive proposition in the theory of money, indeed, the proposition that historically spawned monetary theory as a special discipline, has been that an increase in transactions will cause a proportionate (or almost proportionate) increase in the demand for money as long as the ways in which bank accounts are monitored remain unchanged. And since changes in monitoring might well be considered a long-run, rather than a short-run, response to changes in endogenous economic variables, the demand for money will be almost proportional to the level of transactions. The preceding is a rough description of Irving Fisher's monetary theory (1911), and the proposition has been considered so obvious as to occasion virtually no comment anywhere-not even by John Maynard Keynes, whose transactions demand for money is proportional to income, which is his measure of transactions (1936, p. 201). Elementary textbooks often show the demand for money as proportional to transactions (or income) by a simple diagram, wherein an individual receives Y dollars of income at the beginning of the payments period and spends this income at a constant rate over the payments period, ending it with no cash balances. In this case the demand for money is Y/2. This diagrammatic exposition seems quite convincing, and for this reason, as well as the convincing verbal arguments of Fisher and earlier quantity theorists, it is expected that income should enter the demand for money, especially in the short run, as a strong argument. The dependence of the demand for money on income does not automatically make the LM curve vertical, however, because the demand for money may also depend on the rate of interest. As interest rates rise, it pays to monitor bank accounts more frequently and, as a result, to hold less money since the opportunity cost of money holdings is the interest lost from not holding alternative interest-bearing assets. Thus, according to William Baumol (1952) and James Tobin (1956), the demand for money depends both on income and interest. But calculations of the gains to the average money holder from adjusting his monitoring policies to new optima, following changes in income and interest, show these gains to be quite trivial, especially prior to the current recent period of double-digit interest rates. The smallness of these gains and the inability of any speculator to aggregate the gains of the many individual money holders, suggest that the adjustment of the monitoring of *University of California-Berkeley.

In the early twentieth century, securities underwriters commonly held directorships with American corporations. Section 10 of the Clayton Antitrust Act prohibited bankers from serving on the boards of railroads for which they underwrote securities. We find that following the implementation of Section 10, railroads with strong preexisting relationships with underwriters saw declines in their investment rates, valuations, and leverage, and increases in their costs of external funds. Reassuringly, we do not observe similar effects among industrials and utilities, which were not subject to Section 10. Our results are consistent with underwriters on corporate boards acting as delegated monitors, and highlight the potential for regulations intended to address conflicts of interest to disrupt valuable information flows.

It ought to be a prime area for academic inquiry but only a few of the less timid-Mills, Galbraith, Sweezy, Baran, Heilbroner-have attempted it. Two of the five are dead. One might add that a second major topic on which amazingly little recent work has been done by the academics is the distribution of income and wealth. Notable exceptions Robert Lampman springs instantly to mind-do exist but the most casual of inspections of the A merican Economic Review's annual lists of dissertations, approved and prospective, implies that when a graduate student analyzes inequality it is probably in order to construct a mathematical model elegant enough to earn him his doctorate. All too rarely does the dissertation focus upon the gritty statistics of income and wealth distribution. Still less frequently does the apprentice scholar seek to improve the data or bring them up to date. In so saying, I allege neither malice nor corruption on the part of my brethren. There is no need to be sensational, for elements of technical convenience complement the ideological predispositions of a rather conservative guild as sufficient explanation of the condition. As all know, reputations are made and degrees earned more quickly and dependably by theorists than by quantitative workers. As for the ideological inclinations of the profession, I take as handy illustration the treatment which Samuelson accords to unions in the eighth edition of his Economics. Chapter 7, Labor and Industrial Relations, is the only chapter entirely devoted to unions. In fourteen pages of text, Samuelson says something about union structure; the history of the American labor movement; communism, corruption, and democracy in unions; labor legislation; and current issues in collective bargaining. Unions pop up again in Chapter 29. Here three pages on wage determination explain the four methods by which unions seek to raise the compensation of their members. Possibly with relief, Samuelson quickly surrenders the task of evaluating the significance to the economy of labor unions to accredited experts. He quotes Albert E.

Estimates that recognize that demand conditions and vendor labor supply decisions simultaneously determine the vendor wage always find substantial labor supply elasticities, typically in the .55–.65 range. In contrast, estimates that ignore the endogeneity of the vendor wage yield severely downward-biased labor supply elasticities.

Yet only a minuscule part of their professional training is focused on how to become a good teacher. It is not clear that our teaching performance is much better now than it was twenty-five or fifty years ago. The Committee on Economic Education (CEE) of the American Economic Association (AEA) has since the 1950's operated under a broad and challenging mandate-to help improve the teaching in college and university economics. The CEE played a major role in a big push to improve teaching at all levels during the 1960's. Activities included a National Task Force on Economic Education, comprised of six of the nation's most distinguished economists who were asked to suggest the economic essentials that each citizen-to-be should have in our democratic, largely market-directed economy; a year-long CBS and PBS economics course, including work for credit at many colleges and universities; a nationwide program of summer workshops for teachers; and a major push on research on the effectiveness of different kinds of teaching. Several of these projects were established on a continuing basis. Others served their purposes and faded away. Thus, the CEE of the 1970's inherited a large agenda of workin-progress. But much as the CEE of the 1950-60's accomplished, there was much more to be done to improve the teaching of economics at all levels, and, in 1973, Bach as out-going chairman spelled out a challenge, An Agenda for Improving the Teaching of Economics for the next decade. The new committee developed a wideranging program of continuing and new projects. The committee's activities have been project oriented. These projects, with approximately one million dollars of foundation grants over the decade, will be discussed here around three broad themes: training economic educators, developing economiceducation research, and establishment of the Journal of Economic Education (JEE).

https://openalex.org/W1523115408,John Yinger,Capitalization and the Median Voter.,1981,The American Economic Review,"The past decade has witnessed a strong interest among students of local public finance in models of voting with one's feet and in models of actual voting. Several authors, including Noel Edelson, Susan Rose-Ackerman, and Michael Lea, have recognized that these two types of voting must be considered simultaneously. The capitalization of local fiscal variables into house values, which is a by-product of voting with one's feet, influences the decisions of the median voter; and the pattern of local services that arises through actual voting influences the allocation of households to communities. A full-fleged merger of the two types of voting requires an analysis of capitalization in a model that considers both the housing market and the local voting process in a metropolitan area with diverse local governments financed by property taxes. Previous articles have focused on pieces of this puzzle. This paper reviews my attempt to bring these pieces together. My analysis reveals that, regardless of supply responses, capitalization is a feature of long-run equilibrium. Furthermore, in the presence of capitalization, an efficient pattern of local services cannot be obtained through voting with one's feet, but must be obtained instead through actual voting. If preferences in a community are not too diverse, the median voter will pick the efficient level of services with or without capitalization. However, the median voter's choice may not be efficient in an extremely heterogeneous community. In addition, capitalization breaks the link between tax payments and the choice of a community, and thereby insures that the property tax is not a benefit tax; in other words, it insures that housing is underconsumed relative to other goods. These results provide a framework for evaluating state and federal policies toward local governments. Without much heterogeneity within communities, one could achieve efficiency by eliminating the property tax or offsetting it with large subsidies to housing. These approaches are not realistic, however, and a second best solution is to cut back local services. The form of such a cutback is important. I show that tax limitations do not lead to efficiency, but that a second best solution could be obtained by redesigning intergovernmental grants.",economics

https://openalex.org/W1539075183,James A. Wilde,Labor Supply and Tax Rates: Comment,2016,The American Economic Review,"In a recent paper in this Review (1983) James Gwartney and Richard Stroup (G-S) take with what they assert is the widespread view (p. 447) that because changes in tax rates have a theoretically indeterminate effect on individual labor supply, the impact of changing tax rates is also indeterminate at the aggregate level. Gwartney and Stroup suggest, for example, that if the initial output of public goods is optimal and the government cuts taxes and expenditures by equal amounts, the forgone public goods would be valued as highly as the private goods that individuals purchase with their increase in disposable income. Hence, aggregate real income would not rise, but remain at its pre-tax-cut level. Gwartney and Stroup state that under these circumstances, a tax cut's impact on aggregate labor supply would not be indeterminate, but labor inducing, because in the aggregate there is no income effect, only a positive substitution effect.1 Gwartney and Stroup illustrate this point by examining the aggregate labor supply effects of an increase in transfer payments financed by an exactly offsetting increase in income taxes. They argue that if the transfer payments are income conditioned, this policy would decrease net wage rates for transfer recipients, as well as for taxpayers, thereby producing work-reducing substitution effects for all members of society. On the other hand, the aggregate change in disposable income in the economy would be zero since, by design, the expansion in transfers is exactly offset by the increase in taxes. They conclude that, unless recipients and taxpayers respond differently to a given change in disposable income, the income effect of the tax-transfer program will leave both the aggregate supply of labor and consumption of leisure unchanged. [But] Of course, the substitution effect will still be present. Unambiguously, it will induce individuals to work less, although how much less is strictly an empirical issue (p. 450). In this comment, we demonstrate that the G-S tax-transfer illustration and the policy implications drawn from it are highly misleading. We first show that the G-S conclusions about the relationship between tax rates and labor supply are based upon strong assumptions about the degree of homogeneity in the population and that without these assumptions, their conclusions are not guaranteed to hold. We then use microsimulation techniques to challenge the impression given by the G-S paper that more redistribution must necessarily imply a reduction in the labor supply and output of the economy.",economics
https://openalex.org/W2086819839,Eric Maskin,The Invisible Hand and Externalities,1994,The American Economic Review,"When economists contemplate the invisible hand at work, they generally think of competitive markets. But there are some circumstances in which markets are not supposed to operate well (i.e., in which the invisible hand is thought to falter). A leading cause of market failure, many argue, is the presence of significant externalities. With such externalities, the first welfare theorem does not apply, and so competitive equilibrium-if it exists at all-is not typically Pareto optimal. In the tradition of A. C. Pigou (1932), the typical response to this lack of optimality is for the government to step in and introduce corrective policy, usually in the form of taxes or subsidies. There is, of course, a strong antiPigouvian tradition, as well. Specifically, proponents of the Coase theorem (Ronald Coase, 1960) have contended that, despite externalities, unrestrained bargaining and contracting ought to be sufficient to generate an efficient outcome. (Indeed Coase's own celebrated example was a case of externalities.) Thus, even if formal markets themselves fail, the invisible hand nevertheless succeeds, and outside intervention or design is not required. Recently, Joseph Farrell (1987) argued that, even when free bargaining is permitted, the laissez-faire conclusion inherent in the Coase theorem may founder if agents have incomplete information about one another's relevant characteristics. I shall show, however, that the problem that Farrell identified is due only to monopoly power and is not peculiar to externalities. Indeed, in this paper, I shall take a modified Coasian stance. I shall attempt to show that, in spite of externalities and incomplete information, private contractual agreements suffice to achieve efficiency, as long as no agent is big enough to have significant market power. This conclusion must be qualified, however, with the proviso that, if the externality is (i.e., no one can be excluded from its effects), the government must intervene to prevent free-riding on the agreements. Intervention, in this case, amounts to establishing the right of an agent providing a positive external effect to collect a fee for increasing the effect from all who enjoy it, even if they are not parties to a contract with the provider. Symmetrically, providers of a negative externality can collect a fee for diminishing the effect from all their victims. In either case, however, the fee is set endogenously, that is, it is determined by the contractual arrangements rather than by the government. This result for nonexcludable externalities (which include pure public goods) provides support for a fairly laissez-faire stance toward externalities but turns on an important assumption, namely, that parties always write contracts so as to maximize their social surplus (subject to incentive and individual-rationality constraints). I will return to this assumption in the final section.",economics

Although words in focus were accented and those out of focus were not, there were few supralaryngeal differences between accented words when they were produced in the broad focus context and unaccented target words (out of focus). Thus, accentuation per se did not appear to lead to supralaryngeal modifications. However, there was a clear distinction between the supralaryngeal articulation of words in broad focus and those in contrastive focus. We conclude that supralaryngeal articulation – in terms of acoustic duration and lip kinematics – is related directly to the expression of focus structure and contrastivity, and is not, contrary to conclusions drawn in previous studies, mediated by the presence or absence of accent.",linguistics

We analyze such a “cyborg body” with the help of a cognitive semiotic framework, benefiting from pheno-methodological triangulation, and the conceptual-empirical loop. Further, adopting a broad notion of phenomenological embodiment, with focus on both lived experience and external representations, we show that claims that “the cyborg” is the very nature of humanity are mistaken as they misrepresent the experiences of people with prosthetic limbs. Finally, we apply the Semiotic Hierarchy model to the levels of selfhood that need to be reconstructed when incorporating a prosthetic limb, distinguishing between subjective, intersubjective, and signitive levels. We conclude that the “lowest” level concerning the body schema, agency and ownership is hardest to reconstruct, supporting arguments for the centrality of proprioception for a sense of agency and ownership.",linguistics

The present study provides evidence for the efficacy of atDCS in improvement of associative lexical learning in healthy adults, by developing and employing a novel word-learning paradigm. Participants underwent single sessions of anodal and sham stimulation applied over the left posterior temporo-parietal junction, while learning ambiguous words paired with corresponding dominant, subordinate, and non-word meanings. The ability to recall each paired word was tested on a Cued-Recall task and the ability to recognize acquired non-words amongst distractors was tested using a Recognition task. The results revealed significant atDCS effects for non-word recall compared to sham stimulation in the Cued-Recall task, whilst average correct reaction times were not significantly different between stimulation conditions for the Recognition task. These results provide direct evidence that atDCS strengthens associative links produced between ambiguous words and non-words during initial word retrieval, indicating that these newly acquired words become integrated within participants’ pre-existing linguistic experience. This study contributes important information on healthy language processing and highlights the efficacy of atDCS in improvement of language recovery in clinical domains.",linguistics

The current study examined two possible types of kinematic adjustments which may account for changes in vowel duration. Results indicated that increased speaking rates were effected by changes primarily in the dynamic specification of the jaw opening gesture, but may also have occurred in combination with increased articulatory overlap of the vowel by the successive consonant(s). Consonant cluster productions appeared to be effected solely by increased articulatory overlap, with these kinematic adjustments being maintained across the different speaking rates. As the timing of the jaw closing onset shifted earlier for cluster productions, the relative timing of the upper lip and jaw did not remain invariant. Substantial intersubject variation was observed in the implementation of these kinematic strategies. These findings suggest that, in order to achieve the intended acoustic-perceptual goals, both intra- and inter-articulatory timing may not be absolutely invariant, but rather, systematically and individually organized across task manipulations.",linguistics

On Linguistic Inheritance and Contact in the Kalahari Basin,2012,Language dynamics and change,"Lexical evidence has played an important role in trying to establish a “Khoisan” language family. With respect to the southern African languages there is indeed a considerable amount of shared vocabulary across all three major established non-Bantu families subsumed under “Khoisan,” viz. Khoe-Kwadi, Kx’a, and Tuu. A historical reevaluation of this phenomenon is presented in a first comparative treatment of body-part vocabulary, including newly collected data. While our research provides support for the above three main lineages (this evidence is not discussed in this paper), it contradicts the view that vocabulary shared across them should also be interpreted in genealogical terms. Such vocabulary can rather largely be explained as the result of different types of language contact, supporting the current dominant view among specialists about the untenability of a “Khoisan” family. From a general perspective, the article argues against superficial unqualified lexical comparison and for a canonical historical-comparative procedure, whereby one reconstructs bottom-up and evaluates at every step whether genealogical relations should be built up further. Although such an approach is deeply entrenched in the traditional method, it is often neglected in many areas of historical language research.

This process of priming is thought to involve two distinct processes, one that is reflexive and unconscious, and the other, which is voluntary and intention-driven. It is believed that a dysfunction in one or both of these processes may result in the pattern of thought disorder in schizophrenia. In an attempt to better understand disorganized speech and thought disorder, we examine language processing in schizophrenia by separately studying reflexive and voluntary priming processes using a lexical decision semantic priming task, that is similar to the landmark study with controls by Neely [(1977). Semantic priming and retrieval from lexical memory: Roles of inhibitionless spreading activation and limited-capacity attention. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 106, 226–254]. In two experiments, we tested a total of 40 schizophrenic and 40 control subjects. In both Experiments 1 and 2, schizophrenic subjects showed greater semantic priming than control subjects in the reflexive task condition, demonstrating that they seem to exhibit excessive priming of the semantic network. On the other hand, in our study, there were no differences in priming between schizophrenic and control subjects in the voluntary task condition.

The chief reason for upholding this theory is the close affinity between the perfect forms of this verb in Celtic and Sanskrit: OIr. -dnicc and Skr. anaimba. The vowel in the present-tense form in Old Irish has caused some difficulty and has been variously explained (see VG 752, Anm. 3; Pokorny, Altir. Gramm. 48, and IF 35.339). The only possible explanation seems to be that we have here a case of shortening in unstressed position. The expected stressed forms would be: 3d sg. *-&icc, 3d pl. *4-ccat, which became, as stress was lost in context, -ice and -eccat respectively. In the same way one finds OIr. ldcimm 'I leave, let' appearing as leigim and ligim (seldom tIigim) in the modem Irish (and Scottish Gaelic) dialects.2 The influence of numerous compounds (ni-aricc 'does not find' etc.) must also be taken into consideration in order to explain the final victory of the forms with a short vowel. The original Celtic form corresponding to OIr. -ice may therefore have been (3d sg. pres. ind.) *anket, which in Goidelic changes its a into e (and i) before the nasal consonant cluster. In Welsh a corresponding stem is found in rhangu (earlier rhanghu, now rhyngu, see below), which is chiefly found in the phrase rhangu (rhyngu) bodd 'satisfy, please', lit. 'reach (someone's) pleasure' (cf. OIr. rice a less 'needs', lit. 'attains the advantage of it'), e.g. ? malphei edrfch a ranghei uod idaw Y weith 'as it were to see if his work would satisfy him' (see Strachan's Glossary s.v. rengi, in Introduction to Early Welsh).

The findings reveal their changes and progress in the following variables: knowledge about the variety and subtlety of both the home and target cultures, a different worldview, and cultural study methods; awareness of the importance of differences and similarities between the home and target cultures, their negative reactions to these differences (e.g., fear, ridicule, disgust, feeling of superiority, etc.) and therefore, critical evaluation of the target and home cultures; attitudes from excitement or blind admiration of the target culture to confusion, anxiety or frustration about the cultural differences, later to toleration and appreciation of cultural differences, adaptation to the target culture, and eventually to openness and readiness to suspend disbelief about other cultures and belief about one’s own; skills to contrast the target culture with their own, to demonstrate a capacity to interact appropriately in a variety of different social situations in the target culture and resolve cross-cultural conflicts and misunderstandings.

Evidence for a normal developmental progression in the mastery of the grammatical morphemes was also forthcoming. In an analysis of individual complex sentence structures, no relationship was found between relative frequency of use of different types of complex sentences and presumed order of acquisition. However, subjects' ability to combine complex sentences did appear to be related to the presumed order of acquisition, although other factors may have also contributed to this relationship. Unexpectedly, a significant negative correlation was observed between relative frequency of complex sentence use and an estimate of conversational communicative competence.

Against this backdrop, this paper reports a study investigating the association between Chinese EFL learners’ actual word processing and their lexical learning in performing a collaborative oral output task. Interactional and statistical analyses revealed that the participants engaged in four types of word processing; their overall word processing was significantly correlated with both their productive and receptive word acquisition and retention; their different types of word processing were significantly correlated with their productive word learning, but showed variances in correlations with their receptive word learning.

The results largely confirm claims about contrastive vowel categories in Northern and Southern Welsh.

A primary acoustic and perceptual cue to creaky voice quality is a low fundamental frequency. Previous research has shown that listeners can make fine-grained comparisons of speakers' habitual modal pitch, but this study focuses on how a combination of modal and nonmodal phonation affects the perception of habitual pitch. A perception experiment assesses whether listeners are more likely to rate a speaker's utterance as being holistically lower in pitch if it contains both modal and creaky voice than if it is fully modal speech. Results indicate that for female American English speakers with higher modal pitch, the inclusion of creaky voice leads listeners to rate such utterances as lower in pitch than fully modal utterances, but not for speakers with lower modal pitch. These results are consistent with studies showing that pitch perception interacts with nonmodal phonation, and they relate to previous observations that speakers may utilize nonmodal phonation to manipulate their intended habitual pitch.",linguistics

Partiality is exploited to keep track of which discourse referents have been introduced in the text (thus avoiding the overwrite problem) and to account for cases of anaphoric failure. Another key assumption is that the set of discourse referents is well-ordered, so that we can keep track of the order in which they have been introduced, allowing a semantic characterization of anaphoric accessibility across stretches of discourse. Unlike other dynamic approaches, the system defines semantic values for unresolved anaphors. This leads to a clear separation of monotonic and non-monotonic content (in this case anaphoric resolution) and arguably provides a sound basis for a non-monotonic theory of anaphoric resolution.",linguistics

The system employs a set of heuristics that work in conjunction with a knowledge base to discover underlying regularities that form the basis of summary responses. The system is largely domain-independent, and hence can be ported relatively easily from one data base to another. It can handle a wide variety of situations requiring a summary response and can be readily extended.

https://openalex.org/W1971423708,Anita Henderson,WHAT'S IN A SLUR?,2003,American Speech,"The relationship between social attitudes and lexicography is filled with individual controversies. Debates of varying passions involve prescrip- tive viewpoints on the correct usage of words like unique, geographic lexical variation as in soda versus pop, issues of political correctness, and the labeling and censorship of obscenities. Lexical choice is a matter of con- cern for all who claim to be linguistic consumers. In other words, every- body fights over language at some level. This is particularly true for words which are involved in ongoing cultural and social developments as in references to those in protected classes. 1 For example, under what cir- cumstances is bitch offensive or vulgar? Certainly a statement like getting fired is a bitch may not be construed as vulgar in the same sense that he fired that bitch might be. It is the unenviable job of lexicographers in the United States to record the nuances of meaning and social usages in dictionaries used by a diverse population which communicates in a world of perpetual social change. To examine a narrow point within this general question, I studied the area of ethnic epithets. Attention to ethnic slurs often focuses on single words. For example, a recent foray into this area is Nigger by Randall Kennedy (2002), a law professor who documents what he calls in his subtitle The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word. Extending beyond that individual controversy, this paper examines the work of dictionaries in the selection of entries, definitions, and usage notes with regard to ethnic slurs used for both black and white Americans. The slurs in this study exclude terms for minority groups other than African Americans as well as some ethnically distinct groups who are considered white (e.g., mick and polack for people who are Irish and Polish, respectively). Several areas about the explanations for ethnic slurs are explored here. Are there differences in definitions of ethnic slurs across dictionaries? Are there qualitative differences in the definitions between ethnic slurs which reference blacks and those that reference whites? Given that major dictio- naries of English are compiled by predominantly standard speakers who are white, to what extent are other viewpoints reflected? How has social change for African Americans—especially that which occurred in the post- Civil Rights era—been incorporated into dictionaries through changes in entries, definitions, and usage notes?",linguistics

The relationship between these two variables is subject to the condition: For every x 1 , there must exist an x 2 ; the degree value of x 2 on the scale denoted by the predicate modified by the adverb yue ‘more’ must be larger than that of x 1 on the same scale, and vice versa. These two degree/quantity variables ‘directly’ compared with each other along the scale denoted by the predicate modified by the adverb yue ‘more’ must be associated with two ‘corresponding’ variables (syntactically or semantically) predicated by the same predicate, respectively. These two ‘corresponding’ variables are those that are ‘indirectly’ compared with each other along the scale denoted by the predicate modified by the adverb yue ‘more’.

Some shape/substance items, such as solid artefacts, are more likely to be viewed as shapes, while others, such as liquids, are more likely to be viewed as substances. Still other shape/substance items have no strong bias either way. It is argued that the complementary shape/substance conceptualizations correlate with the two linguistic options in, for example, The wall is of stone and The wall is stone . When the NP in the predicate of such sentences designates the substance that constitutes the referent of the subject, the choice of the nominal predicate correlates with a substance conceptualization, and the choice of the prepositional phrase with a shape conceptualization of the referent of that subject. A general principle is proposed to account for the choice of the nominal predicate in the case of a substance conceptualization of the referent of the subject.

Even if the size of the delay is known a crucial question has still to be answered in every single case: Is it possible that physiological aging or other factors have caused alterations of parameters of voice, speech and language to such a degree that the material basis for identification by human listeners and/or by automatic systems may no longer be regarded as adequate when a new identification task is due? Some studies on auditory speaker recognition suggest that, other variables being equal, a time lag of up to 6 years does not seem to pose a problem. To this author’s knowledge, the question has not yet been directed towards automatic identification systems. The present study uses speech data from ten male speakers recorded at intervals of 11 years and analyses the effect of the delay in terms of (a) the ability of different groups of listeners to detect it, and (b) its influence on the performance of an advanced automatic speaker identification system for forensic applications. Using contemporary samples for both ‘known’ and ‘unknown’ models as a benchmark the automatic speaker identification system identified all speakers correctly with LRs between 102 and over 108. In the non-contemporary condition, where the older samples (i.e. ‘younger’ speakers) were used for the construction of models for ‘known’ and the samples recorded 11 years later for ‘unknown’ speakers, LRs of nine speakers remained unchanged or dropped only slightly. The LR for one speaker dropped sharply. It seems that this is the only case in which vocal aging, but perhaps also other time-related factors, may have played a rôle. The main conclusions of these experiments are that for most male speakers a delay of the size of a decade between voice samples will not pose a problem to either auditory or machine-based speaker identification.",linguistics

She was visiting her native Bulgaria, on her way from her home in Chicago back to England, and died shortly after being diagnosed. Daniela's sudden death was a great shock to all who knew her. Daniela was born on September 5, 1962, in Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria. She completed her B.A. and M.A. degrees at the University of Sofia, and also studied Slavic Philology in Prague before moving to Chicago with her husband Vladimir Tchernev and their son Ivo. Daniela did her subsequent graduate work at the University of Chicago, working under the directorship of Bill Darden and defending her doctoral dissertation in 2002 on Grammatical function and syntactic structure: The participles in the Kievan Chronicle. She was then hired to teach in Chicago's Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures, where she remained for five years. During her Chicago period, Daniela also developed close ties with the Slavic Department at Harvard. As a graduate student, she had participated in the Harvard Ukrainian Summer Institute program in the summer of 1999. She then spent 1999-2000 as a visiting scholar, taking advanced Slavic linguistics courses with Michael Flier and pursuing her doctoral research on historical East Slavic syntax. Daniela also spent 2005-06 at Harvard, having been awarded a Eugene and Daymel Shklar fellowship for the fall to conduct research at the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute and teaching graduate courses in the spring of 2006. In the fall of 2008 she accepted a position at Cambridge, teaching courses in historical Slavic linguistics. Daniela pursued a variety of professional activities as a developing scholar. In 1999 her first English publication appeared in these very pages (JSL 7(2): 171-78). This was a Reflections piece entitled Total Fears, in honor of her favorite Czech author Bohumil Hrabal and which described the unusual combination of challenges facing a returning woman graduate student and Bulgarian emigre. Around that time she also launched a publishing venture called the Aleko Society (Obstestvo Aleko', in honor of a much earlier Bulgarian with a Chicago connection, Aleko Konstantinov), which published translated collections by award-winning poet Mark Strand, then at the University of Chicago. Another scholarly venture to which Daniela was dedicated was the Norwegian Landslide of the Norm project, which studies interrelations between linguistic liberalization and literary development in Russia during the post-Revolutionary years of the 1920s and the post-Soviet period of the 1990s. …",linguistics

Assessments of the effectiveness of this move vary, but so far, no empirical study has been conducted to examine it. This paper reports two studies of the application of prototype theory in NOECD. The first regards the use of the theory in defining and sense organising, and the second concerns users’ perception of the effectiveness of the organisation of sense. The first study is qualitative, and it examines how prototype theory is exhibited in defining and sense organising. The second study is empirical and consists of a test of dictionary users’ vocabulary retention and some follow-up questions. In this second study, it was found that the prototype strategy adopted by NOECD, of identifying a core sense and grouping subsenses around it, contributed little to improving user efficiency in memorising word meanings. Several possible reasons are proposed to account for the ineffectiveness: the influence of L1, limitations of prototype theory, users’ inadequate dictionary skills and others. It is concluded that these challenges could be addressed by compiling nation-specific dictionaries for specific users.

RM refers to speakers each using a different language to speak to each other, while understanding the language used by the other speaker. Previous research has identified this practice as most likely to occur among typologically related languages, in specific contexts and in circumstances of explicit language negotiation. Our data, comprising spontaneous workplace interactions and interviews with cross-border workers at a range of workplaces in Luxembourg, broadens this picture to show RM being used between speakers of quite different language varieties, in a wide range of workplace contexts and for a variety of relational and transactional purposes. Using a dual analytical approach combining interactional sociolinguistics and language ideology analysis, we investigate both interactional characteristics and ideological constructions of RM, and consider the relative influence of linguistic and extralinguistic factors on this everyday multilingual practice at work.",linguistics

A cross-cultural dialogue on prescriptivism,2004,Language Sciences,"This paper contrasts radically differing views of linguistic prescriptivism in two societies, American and Israeli, by applying them to consideration and discussion of a familiar problem, that of the status of Black English in the United States. Since the mid-1960s, academic linguists in the United States have devoted considerable effort to arguing for the legitimacy of Black English. However, these efforts have not involved the development of a standard, a fixed writing system, and the writing of comprehensive and authoritative reference grammars and dictionaries which can be used as a basis for prescribing ‘correct’ and ‘incorrect’ usage. From the American viewpoint, it is evidently natural that academic linguists should not have taken these steps; for Israelis, on the other hand, this not only seems unnatural but difficult to understand, because to date all language legitimization programs have involved taking such steps. These differing views are shown to follow from differences in the nature and conceptualization of linguistic prescriptivism in American and Israeli society.",linguistics

Müller,How recurrent gestures mean,2017,Gesture,"Drawing upon corpus analyses of recurrent gestures, a pragmatics perspective on gestural meaning and conventionalization will be developed. Gesture pragmatics is considered in terms of usage-based, embodied and interactively emerging meaning. The article brings together cognitive linguistic, cognitive semiotic and interactional perspectives on meaning making. How the interrelation between different types of context (interactional, semantic/pragmatic/syntactic, distribution across a corpus) with the embodied motivation of kinesic forms in actions and movement experiences of the body might play out in the process of conventionalization is illustrated by discussing three recurrent gestures : the Palm-Up-Open-Hand , the Holding Away , and the Cyclic gesture . By merging conventional and idiosyncratic elements recurrent gestures occupy a place between spontaneously created (singular) gestures and emblems as fully conventionalized gestural expressions on a continuum of increasing conventionalization (cf. Kendon’s continuum: McNeill, 1992 , 2000 ). Recurrent gestures are an interesting case to study how processes of conventionalization may involve emergent de-compositions of gestural movements into smaller concomitant Gestalts (cf. Kendon, 2004 , Chapters 15 &amp; 16). They are particularly revealing in showing how those de-compositional processes are grounded experientially in contexts-of-use and remain grounded in conventionalized, yet still embodied, experiential frames.",linguistics

https://openalex.org/W2288586103,Chao Li,Competing motivations and ditransitive encoding and ordering,2015,Studies in Language,"The paper proposes that the three main ditransitive alignment patterns result from the competition between the Event Construal Constraint (ECC) motivated from event semantics and the Animacy(/Definiteness) Hierarchy Constraint (AHC) motivated from inherent role properties. The ECC and the AHC lead, respectively, to the Theme (T) and the Recipient (R) of a ditransitive verb being coded in the same way as the Patient (P) of a monotransitive verb. The competition model also correctly predicts the difference in the frequency of the indirective and secundative alignments. The indirective preference in flagging results from flagging’s being more sensitive to event role properties (cf. ECC) and the secundative preference in indexing results from indexing’s being more sensitive to animacy and definiteness (cf. AHC). Moreover, the paper argues that both the ordering of R and T nominal arguments in flagging and the ordering of R and T bound forms in indexing can be successfully accounted for through the interaction of the following constraints: the Animacy (/Definiteness) Effect on Ordering, the Weight Effect on Ordering, and the Coding Effect on Ordering (i.e. which ditransitive role is coded in the same way as the P).",linguistics

However, the empirical quantitative results presented in this article will show that the situation is far more complex, at least in two distinctive areas of mid Wales where a substantial degree of variation can be seen in the quality of various vowels. Indeed, it will be clear from the discussion that follows that vowel length is only one factor with which vowel quality varies, and that other linguistic factors appear to be equally as important, e.g. the vowel's position within the word (i.e. the syllabic environment), and the phonetic context (e.g. whether the vowel is followed by a single consonant or a cluster in stressed penultimates). It will therefore be argued that previous assumptions that Welsh vowels of the same length behave uniformly across all contexts do not appear to hold, and that the effects of other relevant linguistic factors have been largely overlooked.",linguistics

Instead, following upon suggestions by Roman Jakobson, the Tartu school, and, more implicitly, Charles Sanders Peirce, the notion of translation has been generalized to cover more or less everything that can be done within and between semiotic resources. In this paper, we start out from a definition of communication elaborated by the author in an earlier text, characterizing translation as a double act of meaning. This characterization takes into account the instances of sending and receiving of both acts involved: the first one at the level of cognition and the second one at the level of communication. Given this definition, we show that Jakobson’s “intralinguistic translation” is, in a sense, the opposite of translation and that his “intersemiotic translation” has important differences and well as similarities to real translation. We also suggest that “cultural translation” has very little to do with translation proper except, in some cases, at the end of its operation.

When including only a subset of trials for which participants provided expected translations for the target sentences (i.e., translating the English prepositional dative construction into a Chinese prepositional dative sentence and translating the English double-object construction into a Chinese double-object sentence), the effect of cross-linguistic influence emerged only in a certain type of verbs. When including all trials in the analysis, we found the effect of cross-linguistic influence for all verb types.

Comparing the formal properties of the DOC-encoded ditransitives and those of other three-argument constructions, I claim that Ainu presents a counterexample to KITTILÄ’s (2006) Universal 1, since the so-called most typical ditransitive verb ‘give’, viz. the derived verb kor-e lit. ‘make/let sb have sth’ in Ainu, is outranked in formal transitivity by the underived three-argument verb o ‘put/place sth (PL) on sth’ of a non-ditransitive case frame.",linguistics

A Viterbi algorithm is applied to find the probability scores of a test tone scored by the models during the recognition phase. In speaker-independent tone recognition experiments, the average recognition rate was 97·9% for isolated monosyllabic words, 92·9% for disyllabic words, and 91·0% for trisyllabic words.

The prediction algorithm is based on time tracking the joint trajectory of the harmonic contours, this process also provides a voiced/unvoiced detection parameter.

The proposal draws on and develops Klein's (1998) arguments for a decomposition of Finiteness: whereas Klein originally proposed that finiteness should be understood as involving at least two independent components—tense and assertion (validity)—this is elaborated to three in the present analysis, with polarity added as a distinct projection intermediate between the other two projections, to the left of Outer Aspect. Contrastive intonation—polarity emphasis—is argued to be able to target either polarity or assertion, by default the former; cf. Battlori and Hernanz (2011). With regard to assertion itself, it is shown that these features are projected rather low in Vietnamese phrase-structure, immediately to the left of the predicate-phrase. It is further claimed on the basis of evidence from imperative, interrogative and modal constructions that this low structural position hosts many other illocutionary features in Vietnamese (notwithstanding the evidence of Romance and Germanic languages, which seem to support a much higher position for such features on the left periphery of the clause).

In the former case the genitive relation is provided by the relational head noun, in the latter the source of the relation is taken to be provided by the utterance context. Our analysis uniformly assumes only one syntactic type for genitive NPs, viz., one that forces a genitive NP to combine only with relational nouns. In cases with inherently non-relational head nouns, such as the girl's car, we hypothesize that the genitive NP coerces a shift of the meaning of the head noun so that it becomes relational. To determine the sort of meaning shift which is carried out, we appeal to the qualia structure of the lexical entry for the head noun. A consequence of this analysis is an extension of the area of lexically determined interpretations and a corresponding reduction of the context-determined, pragmatic area.",linguistics

Secondly, this pronoun-case-agreement order contrasts with the order found in garden variety possessive structures: ordinary possessive DPs feature the order noun-agreement-case. The goal of this paper is to offer an account of these puzzling phenomena. I argue that a PP structure in which PPs are projected from a silent place noun and the Ground is merged as the possessor of place (Terzi 2005, 2008, 2010; Botwinik-Rotem 2008; Botwinik-Rotem and Terzi 2008; Pantcheva 2008; Cinque 2010a; Noonan 2010, and Nchare and Terzi 2014) allows an enlightening analysis of the appearance and position of the possessive agreement in PPs. I also discuss how certain surface differences between PPs and ordinary possessive constructions can be accounted for while maintaining the possessive analysis of PPs. By showing that a PP structure with a possessive core yields a natural account of the intricate Hungarian data, the paper strengthens the case for a possessive-based approach to PPs in Universal Grammar.",linguistics

In this article, we look beyond engineering goals and analyze the relations between languages in computational representations. We introduce a methodology for comparing languages based on their organization of semantic concepts. We propose to conduct an adapted version of representational similarity analysis of a selected set of concepts in computational multilingual representations. Using this analysis method, we can reconstruct a phylogenetic tree that closely resembles those assumed by linguistic experts. These results indicate that multilingual distributional representations that are only trained on monolingual text and bilingual dictionaries preserve relations between languages without the need for any etymological information. In addition, we propose a measure to identify semantic drift between language families. We perform experiments on word-based and sentence-based multilingual models and provide both quantitative results and qualitative examples. Analyses of semantic drift in multilingual representations can serve two purposes: They can indicate unwanted characteristics of the computational models and they provide a quantitative means to study linguistic phenomena across languages.",linguistics

However, the archetypal electrolarynx suffers from a monotonous tone and the inconvenience of requiring manual control. This paper presents the potential of pattern recognition to support electrolarynx use by predicting fundamental frequency (F0) and voicing state (VS) from surface EMG of the infrahyoid and suprahyoid muscles, as well as from a respiratory trace. In this study, surface EMG signals from the infrahyoid and suprahyoid muscle groups and respiratory trace were collected from 10 able-bodied, adult males (18–60 years old). Participants performed three kinds of vocal tasks – tones, legatos and phrases. Signal features were extracted from the EMG and respiratory trace, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with radial basis function kernels was employed to predict F0 and voicing state. An average root mean squared error of 2.81 ± 0.6 semitones was achieved for the estimation of vocal frequency in the range of 90–360 Hz. An average cross-validation (CV) accuracy of 78.05 ± 6.3% was achieved for the prediction of voicing state from EMG and 65.24 ± 7.8% from the respiratory trace. The proposed method has the advantage of being non-invasive compared with studies that relied on intramuscular electrodes (invasive), while still maintaining an accuracy above chance. Pattern classification of neck-muscle surface EMG has merit in the prediction of fundamental frequency and voicing state during vocalization, encouraging further study of automatic pitch modulation for electrolarynges and silent speech interfaces.",linguistics

We argue that, in a sentence of the form only A is B, only triggers the conditional presupposition that if something is B, A is B. We show that in a positive-only sentence, the prejacent is a conversational implicature and therefore it is cancellable. Instead, in a negative-only sentence the prejacent is shown to be entailed by any context that satisfies the conditional presupposition and to which the (negative) assertion is added. Hence, the prejacent of a negative-only sentence is not cancellable. The entailment analyses, the strong presupposition analyses and the weak presupposition analyses of only are discussed, together with the problems that each type of theories faces.",linguistics

(250, 500, 750, and 1000 mg. per day) on bile-lipid composition and the frequency of side-effects were studied in 38 patients with gallstones. At a dose of 250 mg. per day, C.D.C.A. therapy did not reduce cholesterol saturation of bile in 3 of 7 patients, but treatment with 500 mg. C.D.C.A. per day or more led to a progressive desaturation of bile with cholesterol, the saturation index (unity representing a saturated, greater than unity a supersaturated, and less than unity an undersaturated solution) falling to 0·91 (±S.E.M. 0·11) with 500 mg., to 0·88±0·08 with 750 mg., and to 0·85±0·06 with 1000 mg.

While the response of bile-lipid composition to C.D.C.A. in individual patients was variable, the overall pattern of results suggested that the higher the dose, the greater the reduction in the saturation of bile with cholesterol. Diarrhœa was present in 40% of patients taking between 750-1000 mg. C.D.C.A. per day, and at these doses serum-glutamic-oxalo-acetic-transaminase was found to be slightly raised on at least one occasion during monthly checks in 7 out of 27 patients: a similar pattern was seen for serum isocitric dehydrogenase. However, other studies of liver function and structure were normal, irrespective of dose.

Shanafelt,Interventions to prevent and reduce physician burnout: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2016,The Lancet,"Physician burnout has reached epidemic levels, as documented in national studies of both physicians in training and practising physicians. The consequences are negative effects on patient care, professionalism, physicians’ own care and safety, and the viability of health-care systems. A more complete understanding than at present of the quality and outcomes of the literature on approaches to prevent and reduce burnout is necessary. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Education Resources Information Center from inception to Jan 15, 2016, for studies of interventions to prevent and reduce physician burnout, including single-arm pre-post comparison studies. We required studies to provide physician-specific burnout data using burnout measures with validity support from commonly accepted sources of evidence. We excluded studies of medical students and non-physician health-care providers. We considered potential eligibility of the abstracts and extracted data from eligible studies using a standardised form. Outcomes were changes in overall burnout, emotional exhaustion score (and high emotional exhaustion), and depersonalisation score (and high depersonalisation). We used random-effects models to calculate pooled mean difference estimates for changes in each outcome. Findings We identified 2617 articles, of which 15 randomised trials including 716 physicians and 37 cohort studies including 2914 physicians met inclusion criteria. Overall burnout decreased from 54% to 44% (difference 10% [95% CI 5–14]; p<0·0001; I2=15%; 14 studies), emotional exhaustion score decreased from 23·82 points to 21·17 points (2·65 points [1·67–3·64]; p<0·0001; I2=82%; 40 studies), and depersonalisation score decreased from 9·05 to 8·41 (0·64 points [0·15–1·14]; p=0·01; I2=58%; 36 studies). High emotional exhaustion decreased from 38% to 24% (14% [11–18]; p<0·0001; I2=0%; 21 studies) and high depersonalisation decreased from 38% to 34% (4% [0–8]; p=0·04; I2=0%; 16 studies). Interpretation The literature indicates that both individual-focused and structural or organisational strategies can result in clinically meaningful reductions in burnout among physicians. Further research is needed to establish which interventions are most effective in specific populations, as well as how individual and organisational solutions might be combined to deliver even greater improvements in physician wellbeing than those achieved with individual solutions.

Matthews,Guidance on rosiglitazone for type 2 diabetes mellitus,2001,The Lancet,"Sir—The National Institute for Clinical Excellence’s (NICE) Guidance on rosiglitazone is a carefully worded appraisal of rosiglitazone based on public evidence. This evidence does not, however, include any outcome data for microvascular and macrovascular disease in type 2 diabetes. The evidence for the use of rosiglitazone in particular, and probably thiazolidinediones in general, hinges therefore on surrogates, of which the most important is glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Agents that lower HbA1c concentrations as monotherapy or combined therapy are likely to reduce microvascular disease and probably macrovascular disease. The thiazolidinediones certainly lower HbA1c, and the evidence is, therefore, that they could be offered as an alternative to injected insulin in patients who cannot take metformin and sulphonylurea. The logic of that is irrefutable. However, the NICE guidelines (para 1.3) suggest that such patients “should be offered rosiglitazone combination therapy as an alternative to injected insulin”. Is there not a difference between what could be done and what should be done? There is no evidence to suggest that the thiazolidinediones are more effective than insulin in the long term. In contrast to the generally sober and evidence-based tone of the NICE Guidelines, the UK Department of Health letter of Friday Aug 18, 2000 (ref 0485) is less constrained. Apparently “it is thought that rosiglitazone may give better protection than insulin against damage to blood vessels”. Where is the evidence for such a statement? We are informed that “it is also easier to monitor whether rosiglitazone is working” than insulin. Is there something built into the structure of thiazolidinediones that makes them easier to monitor? Could we encourage the Department of Health to let us know what this easy monitoring entails? Meanwhile I shall continue to use HbA1c. David R Matthews",medicine

In our experience, the inadvertent harm to patients with opioid use disorders caused by this term has been extensive. Patients who go to 12-step meetings might have to defend their treatment in that setting. Families can be conflicted about a so-called substitution therapy, assuming that their loved ones are unable to adequately address their addiction. Such perspectives emerge in discussions about opioid agonist treatment with patients, family members, the public, clinicians, and policy makers at local and national levels. Use of the non-medical term opioid substitution therapy reinforces the idea that this type of treatment is not part of mainstream medicine. Pharmacotherapies such as insulin or glucocorticoids are not referred to as substitution therapy for diabetes mellitus or Addison's disease. What might take the place of the term opioid substitution therapy? We endorse the term opioid agonist treatment. The single word difference is important. Opioid agonist treatment medications, methadone and buprenorphine, are agonists of the μ opioid receptor. Hence we argue for use of a term that indicates the pharmacological classification of these medications, akin to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The term opioid agonist treatment avoids unintended negative connotations and does not lend itself to misinterpretation. Time has come for WHO and others to retire the term opioid substitution therapy and substitute it for opioid agonist treatment, to promote a therapy that has benefited patients for almost half a century. DAF has received honoraria from Pinney Associates for serving on an external advisory board monitoring the diversion and abuse of buprenorphine. JHS declares no competing interests.",medicine

Our aim was to assess the effects of the antioxidant succinobucol (AGI-1067) on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with recent acute coronary syndromes already managed with conventional treatments. Methods After an acute coronary syndrome occurring 14–365 days before recruitment, 6144 patients were randomly assigned with a computer-generated randomisation list, stratified by study site, to receive succinobucol (n=3078) or placebo (n=3066) in addition to standard of care. Enrolment began in July, 2003; this event-driven trial was stopped in August, 2006, after the prespecified number of primary outcome events had occurred. The composite primary endpoint was time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, or coronary revascularisation. Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00066898. Findings All randomised patients were included in the efficacy analyses. Succinobucol had no effect on the primary endpoint (530 events in succinobucol group vs 529 in placebo group; hazard ratio 1·00, 95% CI 0·89–1·13, p=0·96). The composite secondary endpoint of cardiovascular death, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in fewer patients in the succinobucol group than in the placebo group (207 vs 252 events; 0·81, 0·68–0·98, p=0·029). The tertiary endpoint of new-onset diabetes developed in fewer patients without diabetes at baseline in the succinobucol group than in such patients in the placebo group (30 of 1923 vs 82 of 1950 patients; 0·37, 0·24–0·56, p<0·0001).

Although based on correct statistics, we disagree with their analysis of the situation and their comments about the future of scientific output from Iran. Habibi and colleagues blame the war and economic sanctions alone for the sharp decline in scientific output of Iran and for the long-lasting post-war drop in the number of published articles indexed by Science Citation Index. However, they overlook the consequences of the emigration of numerous skilled Iranian scholars soon after the Iranian revolution of 1979. They also do not take into account the contribution of visiting professors from the USA and Europe to research design and preparation of articles before 1979, after which time most of them left. Scanning the names of authors of scientific articles published before 1979 from centres affiliated to Iran reveals the extent of the contribution of these visiting professors. Another important contributing factor in the decline in biomedical research and scientific production in the 1980s was the reorganisation of the health-care delivery system. Instead of spending its budget on the research sector, Iran decided to train as many physicians and paramedics as possible to meet the chronic shortage that afflicted mostly rural areas. Only after securing a commensurate health-care delivery system was medical research encouraged and promoted. Another misconception of Habibi and colleagues relates to the potential threat of another drastic decline in research output, should the country face further international isolation. This is unsubstantiated, since currently most of the work originating from Iran involves little in the way of foreign collaboration and is growing in a self-sufficient way. In conclusion, considering all the factors mentioned, we believe that any threat or tragedy (short of an unpredictable disaster) augured by Habibi and colleagues is unwarranted.

We analysed trends in cervical abnormalities in women in Victoria, Australia, before and after introduction of the vaccination programme. Methods With data from the Victorian Cervical Cytology Registry between 2003 and 2009, we compared the incidence of histopathologically defined high-grade cervical abnormalities (HGAs, lesions coded as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or worse or adenocarcinoma in situ; primary outcome) and low-grade cytological abnormalities (LGAs) in five age groups before (Jan 1, 2003, to March 31, 2007) and after (April 1, 2007, to Dec 31, 2009) the vaccination programme began. Binary comparisons between the two periods were done with Fisher's exact test. Poisson piecewise regression analysis was used to compare incident rate trends. Findings After the introduction of the vaccination programme, we recorded a decrease in the incidence of HGAs by 0·38% (95% CI 0·61–0·16) in girls younger than 18 years. This decrease was progressive and significantly different to the linear trend in incidence before introduction of the vaccination (incident rate ratio 1·14, 1·00–1·30, p=0·05). No similar temporal decline was recorded for LGAs or in older age groups. Interpretation This is the first report of a decrease in incidence of HGAs within 3 years after the implementation of a population-wide HPV vaccination programme.

Thus, if the full results of the study are not made publicly available, the study will not contribute to medical knowledge and the participants will have been recruited by fraud. This ethical issue is appropriate for institutional review boards and ethical committees to address in the process of reviewing a study.

We investigated the tobacco industry's response to p53 research linking smoking to cancer. We searched online tobacco document archives, including the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library and Tobacco Documents Online, and archives maintained by tobacco companies such as Philip Morris and R J Reynolds. Documents were also obtained from the British American Tobacco Company depository in Guildford, UK. Informal correspondence was carried out with scientists, lawyers, and tobacco control experts in the USA and Europe. We found that executives and scientists at the highest levels of the tobacco industry anticipated and carefully monitored p53 research. The tobacco industry's own scientists conducted research which appeared to cast doubt on the link between smoking and p53 mutations. Researchers and a journal editor with tobacco industry ties participated in the publication of this research in a peer-reviewed journal without clear disclosure of their tobacco industry links.

Without upsetting the maternity ward routine, we studied 45 healthy single newborn babies (24 boys), born consecutively and delivered vaginally at term after uncomplicated pregnancies. Five deliveries required the application of ventouse. The babies were observed during their first 6 h, before being returned to their mother.

Multiple stepwise regression showed that the maternity blues score was the variable that showed most variance. Our results support the idea that assisted delivery, as found by Taylor and collaborators, influences postnatal, spontaneous response to environmental stress.

Millions of additional unintended pregnancies and maternal and child deaths may result. 1996 began with the White House and Congress in political gridlock, with negotiations on foreign aid stalled on the issue of abortion. The Republican-led House of Representatives wanted to bar support of any nongovernmental organization (NGO) which also provided information on abortion, while Democratic President Bill Clinton affirmed that he would veto such legislation. At the end of January, the House passed the Balanced Budget and Down Payment Act (HR 2880) containing clauses which cut the aid budget by 35% and barring new money in the area of family planning until July 1.

Horton refers to the 150th anniversary of the UK's first Public Health Act, which has acted as a catalyst to bring together many professionals involved in public health. The Public Health Act aimed to promote public health, and did not refer to a discipline or to a group of practitioners. Surely today this approach is still the prime commitment: to involve those responsible for education, housing, and transport, just as much as those who work primarily in the field of health, and the participation by the public. Horton blames the recent managerial structure of public health for its absence of passion, suggesting that the discipline should either concentrate on the management of medical services or on the broad determinants of population health. Only by addressing both of these areas can public health deliver to its current developing strategy. The increase in public-health training posts and the demand for a formalised career path for all public-health practitioners indicates a continuing enthusiasm for individuals to join and remain within public health. New structures and more formal responsibilities are also needed. An independent commission, a twin pillar to present structures, could perhaps function in the traditional role of “the guardian of the public health”. Some of the proposed functions of the commission, such as standard setting, are already the responsibility of the Faculty of Public Health Medicine. Last year, the Faculty of Public Medicine celebrated its 25th anniversary. We have contributed to the commitment to strengthen the publichealth function, have supported multidisciplinary public health, and have just agreed to a new category of Diplomate Membership for all professionals who work in public health. The academic basis is less developed than we would all wish, but if Horton had been at our annual scientific meeting he would have seen the evidence base on which current public health is founded and the opportunities for implementing what is currently known and hopefully have been encouraged by our passion for advocacy and our desire to improve health. Public health has no need to rediscover its passion, for it has never lost it. It has managed to ensure that the health of the population of the UK has consistently improved over the past 150 years, not least in the past 25. Horton's call for “new public health” fails to recognise that all-encompassing basis that we have developed over the past years for public health. I cannot agree that public health has lost its way or has become marginal to the life of a nation, but am encouraged that Horton believes there is a renewal of the intellectual heart. The flame of public health is, I believe, well and truly alive and we have an opportunity and a responsibility to ensure that we all work together to radically improve health at local and national levels.",medicine
https://openalex.org/W4238496872,Lawrence Impey,Admission cardiotocography,2003,The Lancet,"Authors' reply Sir—We thank João Bernardes and W A Liston for their comments. In reply to Bernardes, there is indeed interobserver and intraobserver variation in interpretation of cardiotocography. Standardised interpretation by means of a computer program would overcome this difficulty. Success has been achieved in the antepartum period,1Dawes GS Moulden M Redman CW Computerized analysis of antepartum fetal heart rate.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1995; 173: 1353-1354Summary Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar but extending this achievement to the start or duration of labour is very different. We await developments in this area with interest. The use of admission cardiotocography is widespread. In its current form, interpretation is almost exclusively by individuals. Our trial was designed to answer the question: “Does what we currently do benefit our patients?” Our findings suggest that it does not. Evidence with respect to the potential benefits of a computer-interpreted admission cardiotocogram remain absent. Such a tool should also be assessed by means of a randomised controlled trial. But that would be answering a different question. In response to Liston, we acknowledge, as we did in our report, that we show admission cardiotocography to be unhelpful only in women with clear amniotic fluid. Importantly, however, much of the evidence about continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) in labour has also been collected in such women.2MacDonald D Grant A Sheridan-Pereira M Boylan P Chalmers I The Dublin randomized controlled trial of intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1985; 152: 524-539Summary Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar Likewise, we tested admission cardiotocography only, not continuous (EFM) itself. Those who use admission cardiotocography aim to reassure themselves that they do not need to use EFM. Yet EFM reduces neonatal encephalopathy, certainly in women whose amniotic fluid is clear.2MacDonald D Grant A Sheridan-Pereira M Boylan P Chalmers I The Dublin randomized controlled trial of intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1985; 152: 524-539Summary Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar As far as the baby is concerned, therefore, a policy of EFM for all is probably safer than one of admission cardiotocography, because the latter is a poor screening test. EFM is a sensitive, but non-specific test for hypoxia. But many babies with so-called hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy do not have hypoxia; and most babies with hypoxia do well. Moreover, prediction is not the same as prevention. Thus, although an admission cardiotocogram might have discovered, or predicted our neonatal death, the evidence suggests that it would not have prevented it. A common assumption is that hypoxia/acidosis is the only way in which a baby can be adversely affected by labour. The emerging data on maternal pyrexia3Nelson KB Willoughby RE Infection, inflammation and the risk of cerebral palsy.Curr Opin Neurol. 2000; 13: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar points to other mechanisms, which might explain the apparent protective effect of pre-labour elective caesarean.4Badawi N Kurinczuk JJ Keogh JM et al.Intrapartum risk factors for newborn encephalopathy: the Western Australian case-control study.BMJ. 1998; 317: 1554-1558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar The benefits of electronic monitoring in trials and in practice have been, at best, small and at a heavy price interms of operative delivery. The time has come for a rethink. Admission cardiotocographyObserver variation in visual analysis of cardiotocograms was not taken into account by Lawrence Impey and colleagues (Feb 8, p 465).1 However, such variation does arise, including admission cardiotocography,2 and makes randomised controlled trials impossible to interpret.3 Admission cardiotocographyLawrence Impey and colleagues1 report that routine use of admission cardiotocography does not improve neonatal outcome. As the investigators acknowledge, the practice in Dublin is to rupture the membranes when the patient is admitted to the ward in labour. However, in most obstetric units in the UK there is now a midwife-driven policy to preserve the membranes unless there is delay in labour, so that presence or absence of meconium is not ascertained.",medicine

Then, and I cannot quite put my finger on the exact point, there is an “a ha!” moment where the pieces click into place, and the horizons become clear. From then on, the book unfolds aspect after aspect of original thought, leading to a brighter future view—an affirming trip. Thomas Roberts has taught a course on psychedelics for decades, and this book is a suitable accompaniment. But, more fundamentally, he challenges swathes of current thinking by asking questions about altered states of consciousness, including those induced by psychedelics. The variety of these experiences clearly suggests our minds are multistate, and prompt further questions about the potential of these different states for healing, psychology, cognitive studies, and education. The only “come down” is when he poses bioethical questions of the future, related to what he calls “mindbody psychotechnologies”.

https://openalex.org/W4245518841,The Lancet,Making progress towards leprosy elimination,2006,The Lancet,"People have feared the effects of leprosy for thousands of years and, as a result, the stigma associated with the disease is deeply etched into our collective psyche. Europe was so badly affected during the 13th century that by 1225 there were around 19 000 leprosaria—hospitals to house lepers. By 1350, the disease started to wane in Europe, possibly because the black death killed so many of Mycobacterium leprae's hosts. But today M leprae's effects are still seen worldwide, especially in India where 260 000 of the 408 000 people diagnosed in 2004 reside. In 1991, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution to eliminate leprosy by 2000, defining elimination as reducing the prevalence to below one case per 10 000 population. By 2005, the goal had not been met, despite the provision of free multidrug therapy by Novartis from 2000 onwards. Despite these failures, there will be a great deal to cheer about on World Leprosy Day on Jan 29. In 1985, 122 countries had prevalence rates above one case per 10 000. Now, only nine do: Angola, Brazil, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nepal, and Tanzania. Theoretically, leprosy should have been one of the easy targets for eradication: human beings are the main reservoir; it is easy to treat; and the supply of drugs is plentiful and free. So why has progress been so slow? Social stigma means that many people do not come forward for treatment. In addition, although the drugs are free, centralised leprosy centres can make access to treatment prohibitively expensive for patients—in terms of lost wages and travel costs. In its 2006–10 global strategy, WHO has identified the need to help educate local health workers about leprosy so that they can take responsibility for control of the disease in their area. If they succeed, and if resistance to rifampicin does not develop, then leprosy could well soon be consigned to the annals of history.",medicine

UBE2L3 is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme with specificity for RING-in-between-RING E3 ligases, including HOIL-1 and HOIP, components of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which has a pivotal role in inflammation, through crucial regulation of NF-κB. We aimed to determine whether UBE2L3 regulates LUBAC-mediated activation of NF-κB, and determine the effect of UBE2L3 genotype on NF-κB activation and B-cell differentiation.UBE2L3 genotype data from SLE genome-wide association studies was imputed by use of 1000 Genomes data. UBE2L3 function was studied in a HEK293-NF-κB reporter cell line with standard molecular biology techniques. p65 NF-κB translocation in ex-vivo B cells and monocytes from genotyped healthy individuals was quantified by imaging flow cytometry. B-cell subsets from healthy individuals and patients with SLE, stratified by UBE2L3 genotype, were determined by multicolour flow cytometry.rs140490, located at -270 base pairs of the UBE2L3 promoter, was identified as the most strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphism (p=8·6 × 10(-14), odds ratio 1·30, 95% CI 1·21-1·39). The rs140490 risk allele increased UBE2L3 expression in B cells and monocytes. Marked upregulation of NF-κB was observed with combined overexpression of UBE2L3 and LUBAC, but abolished by dominant-negative mutant UBE2L3 (C86S), or UBE2L3 silencing. The rs140490 genotype correlated with basal NF-κB activation in ex-vivo human B cells and monocytes, as well as NF-κB sensitivity to CD40 or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) stimulation. UBE2L3 expression was 3-4 times higher in circulating plasmablasts and plasma cells than in other B-cell subsets, with higher levels in patients with SLE than in controls. The rs140490 genotype correlated with increasing plasmablast and plasma cell differentiation in patients with SLE.This study shows that NF-κB activation mediated by LUBAC is exquisitely sensitive to the expression level of UBE2L3. The UBE2L3 risk haplotype is correlated with TNF and CD40 induced NF-κB activation in primary human cells, and with plasmablast and plasma cell expansion in SLE, consistent with the dependence of these cells on NF-κB as a survival factor. Since UBE2L3 is highly expressed in plasma cells, UBE2L3 could be a novel therapeutic target in SLE.Arthritis Research UK, Wellcome Trust, George Koukis Foundation, European Community's Seventh Framework Programme.",medicine

Iodate and iodide levels in table salt may vary for many reasons. There are no studies of the concentration of iodine in salt packs on the shelf and in use (open packs). This study aimed to quantify iodine in salt from twelve brands on the Palestinian market, either produced locally or imported, and both on the shelf and in use (opened). Methods Samples of table salt (99) were collected from randomly selected market places and households in eleven governorates of the occupied Palestinian territory. From each household, three samples were collected; the first when the consumer started to use the salt package, the second when the package was half consumed, and the third when the package was almost empty. In addition, 12 salt packages were purchased from a local market, one package for each studied brand. The samples were treated and the absorbance of iodate in the sample was measured using a spectrophotometer at 665·6 nm, based on a previous method. In brief, a specific mass of salt was dissolved, then potassium iodide, hydrochloric acid, methylene blue, and acetate buffer (pH 4) were added. The solution was mixed and diluted. A reference solution using 99% sodium chloride was also created with this method. Finally, the absorbance of iodate was measured, and the iodate concentration obtained by subtracting the absorbance of the sample solution from that of the reference solution. The iodate content was then compared to the content printed on the salt package. Iodine content was also quantified for a number of samples after exposure to oven heat or being boiled or heated in water, as well as after exposure to light or dark. Findings Of the 99 samples, 23 had lost 61% of their iodine content, 28 had lost 80%, and nine had lost all of their iodine. A little less than half (43 of 93) of the samples followed the Palestinian Standard regarding iodine content (3·5–5·5 mg per 100 g), and 70% (69 of 99) complied with the UNICEF recommendation (1·5 mg per 100 g). Iodine content in a newly opened pack (measured immediately after opening) was different from samples taken when the pack was half full, and when the pack was almost empty (0·023 mg/g, 0·0206 mg/g, and 0·0195 mg/g, respectively). The study also showed that up to 68% of iodine was lost during heating in a water solution, whereas dry heat led to a loss of 26%. Iodine loss was higher in light than in dark storage conditions (its concentration dropped from 48·2 mg/kg to 23·6 mg/kg in the dark, and decreased to 22·2 mg/kg in light). Interpretation A significant proportion of iodine is lost from salt after production and during consumption. There should be more awareness regarding the importance of using iodised salt, and education for consumers about salt storage. The iodine content in salt packages should be monitored by regulatory authorities. Funding None.",medicine

Anal-sphincter pressures, particularly the maximum squeeze pressures, were significantly lower than normal in the incontinent patients, and their ability to retain saline infused into the rectum was significantly impaired. All but 7 of 42 continent subjects could retain more than 500 ml before leaking, whereas 19 of 22 frequently incontinent subjects leaked after infusion of less than 500 ml.

https://openalex.org/W3085403035,David Agren,Understanding Mexican health worker COVID-19 deaths,2020,The Lancet,"An Amnesty International report says that more health workers have died in Mexico than anywhere else. David Agren explores why. Less than 3 weeks after Mexico recorded its first COVID-19 case, staff from a Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) hospital blocked a Mexico City road, demanding medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE). At least 70 protests have followed, according to a report by six former health secretaries, with medical staff decrying shortages of supplies and tests, along with a lack of hospital infrastructure and even proper training. “We didn't even have access to a single test. Now we have some”, said Rafael Soto, an IMSS nurse and spokesperson for the National Union of Health Workers, an organisation formed during the pandemic to improve labour conditions. He said that more equipment has arrived since the protests started, but it is poor quality. The COVID-19 pandemic has heaped misery on Mexico, with more than 70 000 deaths, a tally surpassed only by the USA, Brazil, and India. The country has pursued a strategy of not testing widely or contact tracing, but instead monitoring hospital capacity to inform the relaxation of restrictions. 97 632 Mexican health-care workers were infected between Feb 28 and Aug 23, according to the Pan American Health Organization. On Sept 2, the organisation's director Carissa Etienne said that a survey found that nearly half of Mexican health workers were not provided PPE at work. A Sept 3 report from Amnesty International said that more Mexican health-care workers had died of COVID-19 (1320) than in any other country. The USA ranked second with 1077 deaths and the UK third with 677. The Mexican health secretariat did not dispute the figures, but called the comparison with other countries unfair because none used the same method for recording deaths. In a press conference, Mexico's Director of Epidemiology José Luis Alomía said that Mexican health-care workers with COVID-19 had a mortality rate of 3·8%, lower than that of the general population. Alomía said that 1410 health-care workers had died, almost half of whom were doctors. “[Health-care workers] get less seriously ill and die less than the general population”, Alomía said. “If these two indicators were above what we see in the general population, we might think that it's a risk to be a health professional in Mexico. But it's not.” Brenda Crabtree Ramírez, a physician and infectious disease researcher at the National Institute of Medical and Nutritional Sciences Salvador Zubirán, said that preliminary results of a study using Mexico City data showed that health-care workers were dying of COVID-19 at a lower rate than that of the population as a whole. Mexican health-care workers were infected at much higher rates than their counterparts in other countries, however. Madeleine Penman, a researcher with Amnesty International, said Mexico is “keeping a very disaggregated register of the numbers on health worker deaths. In the Americas, not all countries are actually counting the deaths of health workers with the same detail that Mexico is.” She said that Brazil is undercounting its health worker deaths. Health-care workers, nurses, and researchers offered varying explanations for Mexico's numbers, but working conditions are often mentioned. “A lot of people in the health sector workforce are basically working on informal contracts”, said Penman. “That affects a lot of things in terms of job security and access to sick leave.” Soto said that unions representing health workers were keeping quiet on issues of workplace safety, preferring to please the government rather than address members' demands. Some protest leaders, he said, have had their jobs terminated by their employers or have been sanctioned by their unions. Physicians in Mexico routinely have multiple jobs—often a position in a public institution, augmented by private practice—which compounds issues of stress and exhaustion. Salaries in Mexico's top public hospitals seldom top 1000 monthly, with most physicians earning substantially less, according to interviewees. Daniel Tovar, an emergency medicine physician treating COVID-19 patients in Matamoros on the US border, said “I earn what a medical assistant would make in the United States...That's why we work two or three jobs, in addition to giving classes”. Continuing education for physicians can also be lacking. Crabtree recalled treating a physician with a cough, fever, and diarrhoea, who waited a week to seek treatment and continued seeing patients. “It never crossed his mind this was COVID-19”, she said. Doctors themselves are often not pictures of health, many physicians have noted. “We're an obese country with many diabetics and people with hypertension” said Álvaro Martínez de León, an internal medicine specialist in Matamoros, where he said three physicians died of COVID-19 in early September: two were obese and one had hypertension. “We have many people with these illnesses in the medical community”.

They found that in comparing the treatment group with controls, the patients acquired significantly fewer new AIDS-defining illnesses, had lower illness severity, and required significantly fewer doctor visits, fewer hospitalisations, and fewer days in hospital. This was a small study of 40 patients, and it is certainly not definitive. Nonetheless, it is an important addition to the debate of the efficacy of prayer. The ethical issues that the authors raise are important, particularly regarding the limits of medical interventions. A physician obviously would not prescribe marriage to an unmarried patient simply because it is associated with lower mortality, but one very well might, in psychiatry at least, address issues of social isolation if they are problematic for a patient. In the same way, a physician would not (or should not) prescribe a particular religion for a patient, but encouraging a patient to pursue work on spiritual issues would seem appropriate. We should not prescribe our religious beliefs to our patients, but at the same time, as physicians, we should not ignore this potentially important aspect of mental and physical health. Given the great interest in spirituality in the general population, high quality research in this area should certainly be encouraged.",medicine

No controlled trials have investigated the safety and efficacy of thiacetazone-containing regimens compared with alternative regimens among patients with HIV. In a randomised clinical trial of 191 HIV-positive patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, we examined the safety and short-term efficacy of isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide for two months followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for seven months (RHZ) compared with streptomycin, thiacetazone, and isoniazid for two months followed by thiacetazone and isoniazid for ten months (STH). Between May, 1990, and September, 1991, 191 HIV-positive adult Ugandan patients with acid-fast bacilli sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (93% confirmed by culture) received either STH or RHZ. Subjects had a standard evaluation that included Mantoux skin test, complete blood count with differential white blood cell count, and chest radiography. After starting therapy, subjects were followed-up over one year for three outcomes: complications of anti-tuberculosis therapy, early sterilisation of cultures, and survival. Of 191 eligible subjects, 90 received STH and 101 received RHZ. The overall one-year survival was similar for STH and RHZ (65% vs 72%), but when controlled for baseline differences in Mantoux reaction size and absolute lymphocyte count, the relative risk of death for STH compared with RHZ was 1·57 (95% Cl 1·0-2·48).

I would like to address this point with reference to age. COVID-19 affects all age groups in multiple ways. These effects vary according to individuals’ ages and wider circumstances, be they frail older people, children and youth in education, or workers of all ages. They are also occurring within broader crises of intergenerational justice. The notion of a modern intergenerational contract based around education, reproduction, production, and retirement was in crisis well before the syndemic hit. This was evident on many fronts: mounting pressures of population ageing on public services, care, and pensions; reduced access to secure employment during the working years; growing generation gaps in opportunities to participate in housing markets; changing norms and practices of gender roles through the life course; and recognition that unsustainable consumption by current generations will harm future ones. These tensions, now exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have often been framed in terms of impossible policy dilemmas: should we prioritise keeping schools open, saving jobs, or keeping at-risk older people safe? They have also heightened existing discourses of ageism and youthism (such as blaming younger people for irresponsible behaviour). Increasingly, there seems to be a zero-sum tug of war between the generations. This view of fundamentally conflicting interests is profoundly unhelpful and damaging and could promote bitter legacies of social division. How can we respond to this threat? A starting point will be to critically deconstruct established understandings of intergenerational justice. In the short term, this might generate new ethical frameworks to guide policy responses to those impossible dilemmas of COVID-19; further on, it could contribute to new consensuses of generational equity and sustainable consumption. This high-minded ambition is a lot easier said than done. It will need innovation and inspiration from across the disciplines, be they moral philosophy, economics, or behavioural science. It will also need high-level political support, perhaps in the form of a new UN Commission on generational justice. I declare no competing interests. Offline: COVID-19 is not a pandemicAs the world approaches 1 million deaths from COVID-19, we must confront the fact that we are taking a far too narrow approach to managing this outbreak of a new coronavirus. We have viewed the cause of this crisis as an infectious disease. All of our interventions have focused on cutting lines of viral transmission, thereby controlling the spread of the pathogen.

https://openalex.org/W4253874605,The Lancet,Abortion: access and safety worldwide,2018,The Lancet,"44% of the world's annual 227 million pregnancies are unintended, of which 56% end in abortion, 32% in an unplanned birth, and 12% in miscarriage. These estimates—from a modelling study authored by the Guttmacher Institute and the University of Massachusetts and published by The Lancet Global Health—form the basis of a Guttmacher report on global abortion published on March 20. This analysis was last performed in 2009, since when the rate of unintended pregnancy and abortion in high-income countries has fallen significantly, concurrent with both an increase in the rate of modern contraception usage and a decrease in the number of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion. Low-income and middle-income countries have a higher abortion rate than high income countries, and there has been no significant change in the rate since the 1990s. Unsafe abortions cause 8–11% of global maternal deaths and occur predominantly in low-income and middle-income countries where the most restrictive access policies are concentrated and socioeconomic factors further affect access. Since 2009, the report concludes, a significant rise in medication abortions (using the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol, or misoprostol alone) has substantially improved the safety of clandestine abortions. Misoprostol, which is also used to treat gastric ulcers and therefore often relatively widely available, is now the most common method of abortion in many countries with restricted access. In high-income countries, which usually have the most liberal access policies, the vast majority of abortions are conducted under safe conditions. Many high-income countries have transitioned from majority surgical to majority medication abortions (using the more efficacious combination of misoprostol and mifepristone). This transition, in combination with increasing early detection of pregnancy, has increased the rate of early and very early abortions. The high cost of mifepristone and lack of an alternative mean that surgical vacuum aspiration still predominates in some high-income countries—for example, Germany. Since 2000, 27 countries have expanded the legal grounds for abortion, and only one country (Nicaragua) has restricted access. However, in countries where abortion is legally permitted, access can be compromised in several ways. In the USA, since 2010, 32 states have collectively enacted 338 laws restricting access to legal abortion. On March 16, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) released a comprehensive review of the safety and the quality of abortion care in the USA. The committee who conducted this study concluded that legal abortions in the USA are safe and effective. However, they found that abortion-specific state regulations have created barriers to optimal care for US women and that quality of care was highly dependent on where women lived. 39% of US women of reproductive age currently live in states with no abortion provider and the number of facilities continues to decrease, with the greatest proportional decline in states with the most abortion-specific legislation. The evidence behind some of these state limitations of otherwise legal abortion services is examined by NASEM. The committee recommends that most abortions could safely be carried out in office-based settings, with requirements depending, as for other procedures, on the level of sedation necessary. Providing that the practitioner could arrange safe transfer if complications arose, the committee found that trained physicians, physician's assistants, nurse-midwives, and nurse practitioners could all perform medication and aspiration abortions safely and effectively, without the need for hospital privileges. The committee also recommended further research around the restricted distribution of mifepristone and its potential impact on timeliness, patient centredness, and equity. Surgical abortion procedures still predominate in the USA, with aspiration accounting for 68% of all abortions in 2013. Abortion has become the subject of a highly politicised debate and of the worst kind of value signalling from those in positions of power, who are often protected from the consequences of their policies by gender, geography, and economics. The burden of unintended pregnancies falls hardest on the most vulnerable women. Reducing the stigma, minimising the social and economic consequences of unintended pregnancies, improving access to highly effective modern contraception, and ensuring legal and safe abortions would generate tangible improvements to health. Those with real motivation to protect and support women and children should look to research, not misconceptions, to inform decision making.",medicine

Very occasionally, there is a conflict of interest between mother and unborn child, and few people would doubt that the obstetrician's prime duty is then towards the pregnant woman in his or her care.

The obstetrician, without having personal expertise in all aspects, has to balance pressure to intervene on behalf of the unborn child against received wisdom on maternal risk.

Initial reports indicated that all patients with multiple sclerosis had chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency. We aimed to establish the prevalence of venous narrowing in people with multiple sclerosis, unaffected full siblings, and unrelated healthy volunteers.We did an assessor-blinded, case-control, multicentre study of people with multiple sclerosis, unaffected siblings, and unrelated healthy volunteers. We enrolled the study participants between January, 2011 and March, 2012, and they comprised 177 adults: 79 with multiple sclerosis, 55 siblings, and 43 unrelated controls, from three centres in Canada. We assessed narrowing of the internal jugular and azygous veins with catheter venography and ultrasound criteria for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency proposed by Zamboni and colleagues. Catheter venography data were available for 149 participants and ultrasound data for 171 participants.Catheter venography criteria for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency were positive for one of 65 (2%) people with multiple sclerosis, one of 46 (2%) siblings, and one of 32 (3%) unrelated controls (p=1·0 for all comparisons). Greater than 50% narrowing of any major vein was present in 48 of 65 (74%) people with multiple sclerosis, 31 of 47 (66%) siblings (p=0·41 for comparison with patients with multiple sclerosis), and 26 of 37 (70%) unrelated controls (p=0·82). The ultrasound criteria for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency were fulfilled in 35 of 79 (44%) participants with multiple sclerosis, 17 of 54 (31%) siblings (p=0·15 for comparison with patients with multiple sclerosis) and 17 of 38 (45%) unrelated controls (p=0·98). The sensitivity of the ultrasound criteria for detection of greater than 50% narrowing on catheter venography was 0·406 (95% CI 0·311-0·508), and specificity was 0·643 (0·480-0·780).This study shows that chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency occurs rarely in both patients with multiple sclerosis and in healthy people. Extracranial venous narrowing of greater than 50% is a frequent finding in patients with multiple sclerosis, unaffected siblings, and unrelated controls.

The latter is thought to involve passive transfer or active replication of virus in C.N.S. endothelial cells. In this study histological evidence of mild perivascular encephalomyelitis was found 8-10 days after infection of dogs with canine distemper virus (C.D.V.). C.D.V. antigen and viral nucleocapsids were detectable in the mononuclear cells infiltrating nervous tissue and C.D.V. was isolated from lymphoid tissue and buffy-coat cells.

https://openalex.org/W4312106035,Andrew Green,Nicole Schiegg,2023,The Lancet,"Global health communications specialist. Born on June 2, 1977, in Nashville, TN, USA, she died of colon cancer on Nov 5, 2022, in Washington, DC, USA, aged 45 years. Nicole Schiegg understood how to communicate difficult global public health concepts and to frame messages for international campaigns that encouraged communities to connect and engage with issues around health and women's rights. “Throughout Nicole's career in global public health, she was a fierce champion and advocate of equity, justice, and access”, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told The Lancet. Tedros worked with her regularly, including on his own campaign to become WHO Director-General, when Schiegg served as Communications Advisor. “She was also a bridge builder. With her innate empathy, optimism, and sense of humour, she created linkages across global health and development. And these connections advanced the causes she believed in”, Tedros said. Schiegg attended Auburn University in Auburn, AL, USA, graduating in 1999 with a degree in political science and government. Passionate about politics, she moved to Washington, DC, USA, after graduating, joining the office of the then First Lady Hillary Clinton as a Special Assistant to the White House Millennium Council. “She learned through practice, not through degrees”, said Roopa Dhatt, the Executive Director and Co-Founder of Women in Global Health. Schiegg followed her stint at the White House with positions centred on global health, including working with US embassies to promote the results of the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) as a Senior Public Diplomacy Advisor for PEPFAR in the US State Department. In 2007, she moved to WHO in Geneva, Switzerland, where she became an Advocacy and Strategy Officer for the Stop TB Partnership. She later took on the role of Senior Advisor and Spokesperson for the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in 2010, where she directed the agency's communications. In this role she accompanied Ezekiel J Emanuel, the Vice Provost for Global Initiatives and the Diane vS Levy and Robert M Levy University Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, USA, on a trip to African countries to evaluate USAID's global health programmes. “I had the sense that she had a 360-degree perspective on all the forces that were playing out in whatever situation we were in”, he said. “She had this combination of understanding the difficulties in global health but maintaining this great optimism and idealism for what could be accomplished.” She also crafted USAID's Every Child Deserves a 5th Birthday campaign. “Nicole worked with public health experts at USAID and elsewhere and health ministries around the world because she believed in serving others. But she also had a gift for capturing that idea, a vision, a commitment to do better in a way only she could”, said Rajiv Shah, the former Administrator of USAID and now the President of the Rockefeller Foundation in New York City, NY, USA. In 2018, Schiegg and colleagues formed the C5 Collective, a consulting firm led by women partners. “She was constantly coming up with new and creative ways to connect the Council's work to other initiatives and audiences”, said Mariana Mazzucato, the Chair of the WHO Council on the Economics of Health for All and Professor in the Economics of Innovation and Public Value at University College London, UK, who recently worked with Schiegg. Ahead of COP27 in 2022 “she helped set up two dialogues with civil society organisations to inform the Council's statements on the relationship between climate and health and to build support and traction around its recommendations”, Mazzucato said. “Whatever she put her mind to, she brought extraordinary tenacity and persistence”, Tedros said. Schiegg championed gender equality in global health and chaired the Women in Global Health's Washington, DC, chapter. “She was so committed to elevating women and gender equality”, Dhatt said. A lover of fine dining, Schiegg “organised so many of the women chefs and sommeliers and bakers in celebrations connecting global health and development with women of the food industry”, Dhatt said. “She supported women and lived by that practice in everything that she did.” Before her death, Schiegg established an internship bursary that will connect Auburn University with Women in Global Health. She is survived by her mother, Esther Schiegg. “Nicole was—above and beyond her extensive and undoubted professional expertise—a lovely human being who gave of herself and always had the wellbeing of others in mind”, Tedros said.",medicine

The procedure customarily followed at the Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, University of Münster, Germany, for parents after stillbirth, consists of offering the parents the opportunity to see and to touch their stillborn, child after birth, and discussing with them the emotional consequences of their decision. No recommendation is made by the staff; the decision is left entirely to the parents. In our as yet unpublished retrospective study on 80 women who had undergone termination of pregnancy because of fetal malformation between 15 and 33 weeks of gestation, we investigated the long-term posttraumatic stress response and grief 2–7 years after termination of pregnancy. Almost three quarters (73·8%) of the women in the study group decided to see and hold their dead child after birth, and 15% opted for a burial. No significant differences were recorded in the extent of traumatic response and grief between women who had seen their infant and those who had decided not to do so (p=0·875 on the revised impact of event scale;2Maercker A Schuetzwohl M Erfassung von psychischen belastungsfolgen: die impact of event skala—revidierte version (IES-R).Diagnostica. 1998; 44: 130-141Google Scholar p=0·998 on the perinatal grief scale3Toedter LJ Lasker JN Alhadeff JM.

https://openalex.org/W2411640860,John Tercier,Resuscitation,2004,The Lancet,"In medicine, resuscitation denotes therapeutic manoeuvres intended to reverse acute, life-threatening physiological abnormalities. In popular culture, it connotes the restoration of life. This difference generates clinical and ethical dilemmas when the acronyms CPR (CardioPulmonary-Resuscitation) and DNR (Do-Not-Resuscitate) face each other over the deathbed. Resuscitation was in use in the 14th century for resurrection of the body, soul, or both. In the 17th, it began to refer more exclusively to the body, but still carried implicit recognition of divine intervention. By the mid-18th, physicians were concerned that terms such as “re-animation, re-suscitation, re-vivification” might seem “to imply the act of resurrection”, an act reserved for the “CREATOR” (A Fothergill. A New Inquiry Into the Suspension of Vital Action in the Cases of Drowning and Suffocation, 1795). Thus, “recovery”, “restoration”, or “preservation” were preferred in the newly emerging life-saving protocols. By the mid-19th century, the realms of science and religion having become more discrete, the distinction between resurrection and recovery again sank beneath the surface of resuscitation, which was used to refer to rewarming techniques and manual artificial ventilation. In 1933, William Kouwenhoven reported on Resuscitation by Countershock. In the early 1950s, James Elam and colleagues showed the superiority of mouth-to-mouth over manual ventilation. In 1960, Kouwenhoven and colleagues published Closed Chest Cardiac Massage, and Peter Safar and colleagues presented a resuscitative protocol of mouth-to-mouth, chest compressions, and defibrillation. In 1962, the American Heart Association proposed the term cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The first hospital policies on DNR orders followed a decade later. These sought to open up decision-making at the deathbed, and honour the wishes of the informed patient. DNR marked a crucial adjustment; it was the first medical order for withholding treatment. But, 25 years on, the implementation of DNR orders, advance directives, and living wills remains problematic. The inability of modern science to frame “life” in the absolute, transcendent terms of religion, and the difficulty of determining the value, to a moribund patient, of a future level of function harks back to the fine distinction between resurrection and recovery that is submerged within resuscitation.",medicine

Although it was beyond the scope of our paper to analyse these relations, we agree that the characteristics of falls in our study were probably affected by impairments in vision, gait and balance, and the use of specific drugs.2Rubenstein LZ Josephson KR Robbins AS Falls in the nursing home.Ann Intern Med. 1994; 121: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar Additional review of our dataset indicates that these conditions were common in our study participants.

Eight were classified as having “unsteady gait”, and in tests of standing balance, 11 were able to maintain a stable position, five were unsteady, nine needed partial support, and seven were unable to attempt the test. The mean number of drugs per participant was nine (SD 4); 18 were taking antipsychotics, six antianxiety drugs, 17 antidepressants, six hypnotics, eight diuretics, and 19 analgesics. The cause of falls in elderly people depends on complex interactions between physiological, environmental, and situational factors.3Tinetti ME Kumar C The patient who falls: “It's always a trade-off”.JAMA. 2010; 303: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar By presenting evidence from video capture of the biomechanical causes of imbalance and activities leading to falls in long-term care, our paper adds one piece to a complex puzzle to better understand the cause and prevention of falls in this population. However, we agree that there is certainly more to be gained, in revealing layers of causality and informing patient-based approaches to fall prevention, from larger cohort studies or case-study approaches that link real-life fall data to comorbidities, drugs, and functional status. Most people who fall present with multiple clinical risk factors, making this a challenging task.4Cameron ID Gillespie LD Robertson MC et al.Interventions for preventing falls in older people in care facilities and hospitals.Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2012; 12 (CD005465.)PubMed Google Scholar Furthermore, whereas in some cases the pathway between isolated clinical risk factors and falls might seem clear (eg, glaucoma causing reduced visual field and collisions, or peripheral neuropathy causing foot drop and trips), in other cases, understanding causality is more challenging (eg, for cognitive impairment or drug use). Exciting possibilities lie ahead in combining video evidence with the clinical context to reveal these mechanisms. We declare that we have no conflicts of interest. Falls in older people in long-term careStephen Robinovitch and colleagues (Jan 5, p 47)1 provide video-based evidence of the common characteristics of, and reasons for, falls in older people. The leading causes of falling included incorrect weight shifting (41%), trip or stumble (21%), and hit or bump (11%). However, some of these falls might be due to visual impairment. This issue was not mentioned in the Article. Falls in older people in long-term careStephen Robinovitch and colleagues' analysis through video film of falls in nursing homes adds enormously to our understanding of this common geriatric syndrome.1 However, since a disorder of gait and balance was the most common precipitant of the falls, one important aspect not addressed in the paper was that of the presence of pre-existing gait disorders.

But this “kitchen sink” approach can be misguided.

That example precedes today's data collection technologies of whole genome sequencing (WGS), wearable biosensors, high-resolution imaging, gut microbiome metagenomics, and more.

Roffe also states that carbaril (carbaryl) might be carcinogenic, quoting the British National Formulary.

However, infertility prevalence may be inferred by applying a consistent algorithm to demographic and reproductive health survey data. Using household survey data, we estimate infertility prevalence and trends, from 1990 to 2010, by country and region.MethodsWe developed an algorithm to infer infertility prevalence from commonly collected demographic data by analysing Demographic and Health Survey data. We applied the algorithm to 277 demographic and reproductive health surveys. We corrected for biases arising from the use of incomplete information on past union status and contraceptive use. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends and prevalence of infertility in 190 countries and territories.FindingsIn 2010, among women 20–44 years of age who were exposed to the risk of pregnancy, 1·9% (95% uncertainty interval 1·7–2·2) were unable to attain a livebirth (primary infertility). Out of women who have had at least one livebirth and were exposed to the risk of pregnancy, 10·5% (9·5–11·7) were unable to have another child (secondary infertility). Infertility prevalence was highest in south Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, north Africa and the Middle East, central and eastern Europe, and central Asia. Levels of infertility in 2010 were similar to those in 1990 in most world regions, apart from declines in primary and secondary infertility in sub-Saharan Africa and primary infertility in south Asia (posterior probability ≥0·99).InterpretationIndependent from worldwide declines in the preferred number of children and from population growth, we found little evidence of changes in infertility over two decades, apart from the regions of sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.

To assess the risk presented to the human population by domestic livestock, human-infective T b rhodesiense must be distinguished from non-human-infective T brucei brucei, since both parasites can be present in cattle. We investigated the use of a simple genetic marker to characterise parasites collected from cattle in villages within the new sleeping sickness focus in Soroti District, Uganda. Methods 70 T brucei si samples of known human infectivity status collected from human beings and cattle in Tororo District, Uganda, from 1989 to 1991 were screened for the presence of the human-serum-resistance-associated (SRA) gene by conventional PCR. In 2000–01, blood samples from 200 randomly selected cattle in six villages and two markets in Soroti District were screened for T brucei sl parasites by PCR; positive samples were screened for the presence of the SRA gene. Findings The SRA gene was present in all 29 samples from patients with sleeping sickness in Tororo District. Of the 41 samples collected from cattle at the same time, the SRA gene was present in the eight samples that tested resistant to human serum in vitro, whereas it was absent from all 33 isolates that were sensitive to human serum in vitro. Of the 200 cattle sampled in Soroti District, we estimated that up to 18% (95% Cl 12–23) were infected with T b rhodesiense.

https://openalex.org/W4254175103,Sonia Shah,Dark harvest,2011,The Lancet,"Hollywood has rarely viewed the grafting of organs from one body to another with much tenderness. The basic story line—that organ donors are misguided victims and their recipients exploitative monsters—has dominated films from 1978's blockbuster Coma to last year's My Sister's Keeper. Never Let Me Go, based on the 2005 novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, is no exception. But unlike other Hollywood treatments here the fact of organ exchange is little more than a backdrop for a delicate tale of doomed youth. But what a backdrop it is. Directed by Mark Romanek using the Japanese principle of Wabi-sabi—the beauty of transient and imperfect things—it's a lovely film to behold. The setting is the English countryside in an imagined recent past, in which medical breakthroughs have raised average longevity to 100 years. Among other things, this development has created a massive demand for youthful kidneys, eyes, and other organs to replenish armies of ageing bodies. Here in the real world, where the demand for organ transplants similarly exceeds the supply of donated organs, we struggle along with the gap, rewriting the rules of donation while thousands perish on years-long waiting lists. But in Never Let Me Go, there is a segregated population of donors, reared from birth for the life-shortening, soul-crushing task of relinquishing their organs, one by one, to teams of transplant surgeons. For all that, the film is no nightmarish dystopia. All three of the main characters—the gentle Kathy, played with mesmerising understatement by Carey Mulligan; bossy, aggressive Ruth, played by a ghoulish looking Keira Knightley; and love interest sweet but wishy-washy Tommy, played by Andrew Garfield—accept their lot in this ghastly social arrangement. Destined to perish on the surgical table in their twenties, but bred for low expectations, they rationalise their diminished prospects with visions of themselves as saviours. And anyway, as Kathy muses to herself, isn't everyone's time on earth limited, in the end? In the end, the romantic drama works despite the film's sensational premise. In large part that's because the film's moral universe is not so very much unlike our own. Faced with our own organ crisis, we too continue to enlarge the pool of potential donors. Meanwhile, a black market in organs thrives. The demands of medical progress are indeed unstoppable, even as they deepen the possibility of exploitation. We know all this, but like the protagonists of Never Let Me Go, for the most part we accept it, too. That—not the coerced surgeries and farming of human beings—may be the film's most chilling aspect. https://www.thelancet.com/cms/asset/8626c86e-c1d9-4d05-a6b9-0e2792be3516/mmc1.mp4Loading ...

We describe a large urban outbreak of leptospirosis.Active surveillance for leptospirosis was established in an infectious-disease referral hospital in Salvador, Brazil, between March 10 and Nov 2, 1996. Patients meeting case criteria for severe manifestations of leptospirosis were recruited into the study. The diagnosis was confirmed in the laboratory with the microagglutination test and identification of leptospires in blood or urine. Risk factors for death were examined by multivariate analyses.Surveillance identified 326 cases of which 193 (59%) were laboratory-confirmed (133) or probable (60) cases. Leptospira interrogans serovar copenhageni was isolated from 87% of the cases with positive blood cultures. Most of the cases were adult (mean age 35.9 years [SD 15.9]), and 80% were male. Complications included jaundice (91%), oliguria (35%), and severe anaemia (26%). 50 cases died (case-fatality rate 15%) despite aggressive supportive care including dialysis (in 23%). Altered mental status was the strongest independent predictor of death (odds ratio 9.12 [95% CI 4.28-20.3]), age over 37 years, renal insufficiency, and respiratory insufficiency were also significant predictors of death. Before admission to hospital, 42% were misdiagnosed as having dengue fever in the outpatient clinic; an outbreak of dengue fever was taking place concurrently.An epidemic of leptospirosis has become a major urban health problem, associated with high mortality.

https://openalex.org/W4250642422,The Lancet,Health in the USA: under examination and under repair,2021,The Lancet,"Although the word “health” does not itself appear in the US Constitution, the allusions to it are invited from the outset in the Preamble. The intention is, quite pointedly, “to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity”. But health is written between the lines and has come to approximate the strength, security, and functionality of a country as much as it refers to the integrity and physical condition of its people. The concept and capacity of a nation to be united in health has never been more salient or necessary to evaluate as it is presently for the USA. America—the dream, the great experiment, a more perfect union—has been repeatedly tried and tested through 4 years of the Trump presidency. Where it has fallen short or faltered, the foundational issues and chronic failures of the American health-care, welfare, and social support systems have been painfully exposed and compounded by the Trump administration's actions. It is near farcical in retrospect given the enormity of the COVID-19 pandemic, that the health and wellbeing of Americans was not a focal concern during the 2016 US presidential election. The foremost health issues of the day were the series of congressional threats to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which expanded health-care coverage and regulations, and ongoing judicial challenges for religious exemptions for providing reproductive health access. Yet among medical, public health, and global health communities, the alarm had been raised—American health was in peril by contrast to its peer countries. Life expectancy in the USA had been decreasing since 2014 (from 78·9 years in 2014, to 78·7 years in 2018), a dark guiding star pointing to a constellation of crises, including opioid use, structural racism, and economic inequality, factors that might have contributed to Trump's election. Despite his bombast and lack of political or policy acumen, President Trump had the singular capacity to effectively usher in reactionary, partisan, and agenda-driven legislation and executive actions. Within his first weeks as president in early 2017, he had issued orders that would allow for the repeal of the ACA via the budget reconciliation process, reinstated the Mexico City Policy withdrawing funding from global health programmes that offered abortion or contraception, and restricted immigration from predominantly Muslim countries. It was an opening salvo targeting health that would continue for the duration of his time in office and with the potential to reverberate for generations to come. In response to the concern generated by these extraordinary events, the Lancet Commission on public policy and health in the Trump era was convened in April, 2017, and culminates in a report published on Feb 11, 2021. With the scaffolding of two previous Lancet Series, The Health of Americans in 2014 and America: Equity and Equality in Health in 2017, the present epidemiological landscape of the USA with its many shortcomings has been well documented. Despite widely acknowledged social determinants in American health, the magnification of inequities and disparities during the Trump era forced a reckoning. Health rapidly ascended to a more prominent political position in 2020, coalescing around the need to rapidly improve the COVID-19 pandemic response and the momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement spurred by racial inequality, forces leading to the largest US voter turnout in history and the election of President Joe Biden. However, assuming the office under the most trying of times, President Biden must contend with the continued COVID-19 pandemic and economic fallout in addition to Trump's corrosive legacy. Each roll-back from regulation and every retreat from global cooperation that defined the Trump era has become an action item on a daunting but crucial list: racism, income inequality, immigration protection, universal health coverage, nutrition, the environment, workplace safety, reproductive rights, antiscience, and isolationism. The Commission report stands not simply as a compendium of the misdeeds of the Trump administration, but an opportunity to direct and benchmark improvements in the most vital health policy areas through executive actions, legislation, activism, and diplomacy. It is a massive mandate with which to task any administration, but the Biden presidency has already shown that it will be one of considerable redress and leadership, with rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement one of its initial accomplishments and an immediate executive action identified by the Commission. In striving to form a more perfect union, the USA must first work towards building a healthy one.

His signature legislative achievement, a trillion-dollar tax cut for corporations and high-income individuals, opened a budget hole that he used to justify cutting food subsidies and health care.",medicine

Because misoprostol is an inefficient abortifacient, many women who use it have incomplete abortions and need uterine evacuation.We reviewed the records of women admitted to the main obstetric hospital of Fortaleza, capital of Ceará state, Brazil, between January, 1990, and July, 1992, for uterine evacuation after induced abortion. The number of incomplete abortions induced by misoprostol increased substantially during the first half of 1990, and declined thereafter. Of the 593 cases in 1991,75% were related to misoprostol, 10% to the use of other specified drugs, and 6% to unspecified drugs. For the remaining 9% the procedure used was not recorded; these included 3% in whom abortion had been induced by a clandestine abortionist. The number of uterine evacuations per month fell from 89 in August, 1990, to 62 in July, 1991, when sales of misoprostol in Ceará state were suspended. The fall continued after the sale of misoprostol ceased, to about 20 cases in December, 1991; numbers remained around this level until June, 1992, sustained by clandestine sales.The lack of access to contraception is the main reason for the large numbers of unplanned pregnancies and is a major public health issue for Brazilian women.

https://openalex.org/W2044595301,Craig McClure; Caitlin Chandler; Susan Bissell,Responses to HIV in sexually exploited children or adolescents who sell sex,2015,The Lancet,"One of the crucial gaps in the current HIV response is that we are not reaching children and adolescents aged 10–17 years who sell sex, with life-saving prevention, treatment, protection, care, or support; by protection we refer to all child and social protection interventions that aim to protect rights and provide social and economic support. Under the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)—the most widely ratified human rights treaty—and its Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography, adolescents younger than 18 years are protected from all forms of sexual exploitation and entitled to the right to health. Children are defined by the CRC as all persons aged younger than 18 years. Adolescents are defined by the UN as all persons aged 10–19 years. This Comment focuses on the HIV concerns of children and adolescents aged 10–17 years who are exploited in the sex industry through selling sex, and does not consider other forms of sexual exploitation. The term “sexually exploited children and adolescents aged 10–17 years who sell sex” describes the behaviour that renders this group at-risk of HIV and does not describe identity. Children younger than 18 years who sell sex, irrespective of the reason, are considered under international law to be sexually exploited children. Trafficking, sex work, and HIV: efforts to resolve conflictsTrafficking occurs in sex work as it does in other types of labour. However, the issue of trafficking in sex work has been singled out, its scale and potential for harm frequently mis-stated or exaggerated to bolster antiprostitution arguments, inflame public opinion, and justify repressive and counterproductive police action.1–5 Conflation of sex work with trafficking leads not only to difficulties with definition and harm to sex workers on the ground, but also to conflicts that undermine HIV prevention. A community empowerment approach to the HIV response among sex workers: effectiveness, challenges, and considerations for implementation and scale-upA community empowerment-based response to HIV is a process by which sex workers take collective ownership of programmes to achieve the most effective HIV outcomes and address social and structural barriers to their overall health and human rights. Community empowerment has increasingly gained recognition as a key approach for addressing HIV in sex workers, with its focus on addressing the broad context within which the heightened risk for infection takes places in these individuals. However, large-scale implementation of community empowerment-based approaches has been scarce. Human rights violations against sex workers: burden and effect on HIVWe reviewed evidence from more than 800 studies and reports on the burden and HIV implications of human rights violations against sex workers. Published research documents widespread abuses of human rights perpetrated by both state and non-state actors. Such violations directly and indirectly increase HIV susceptibility, and undermine effective HIV-prevention and intervention efforts. Violations include homicide; physical and sexual violence, from law enforcement, clients, and intimate partners; unlawful arrest and detention; discrimination in accessing health services; and forced HIV testing. HIV and sex workersThe LancetPublished: July 23, 2014With heightened risks of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, sex workers face substantial barriers in accessing prevention, treatment, and care services, largely because of stigma, discrimination, and criminalisation in the societies in which they live. These social, legal, and economic injustices contribute to their high risk of acquiring HIV. Often driven underground by fear, sex workers encounter or face the direct risk of violence and abuse daily. Sex workers remain underserved by the global HIV response. This Series of seven papers aims to investigate the complex issues faced by sex workers worldwide, and calls for the decriminilisation of sex work, in the global effort to tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic.Read more",medicine
