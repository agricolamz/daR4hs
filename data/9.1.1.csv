In the Moselle Towards the end of April 1958, having taken gravel from the bed of the Moselle between Ahn and Machtum, a dredger belonging to the company Hein de Machtum, brought in his load many currencies of Roman gold. They are pieces of: 321 1/2, 1 and 1/2 solidi, struck almost exclusively by the effigies of the emperors Valentinian I, Valens and Gratian, and preserved at the corner of the coin. The coins were discovered scattered in the gravel, especially on the site of the aforementi1d company located at the place called ""Kommert"" near Machtum and the depot of the Bridges and Chaussees located at a place called ""Banzelt"" near Roodt / Syr , where a truck had deposited 2 loads of this ""enriched"" gravel. Several pieces, especially the multiples, had more or less suffered from their passage through the crusher. No trace of a vessel was found, nor any piece of silver or bronze. It is impossible to estimate accurately the number of pieces found, but the information available to us suggests that it must have been more than a hundred. Coins entered private collections or were sold abroad. 2 pieces were acquired by the Cabinet of Medals of the Museum of History and Art, Luxbg. (Nos 24 and 29). The absence in this treasure of the coinage of Valentinian II, raised to the rank of Auguste on November 22, 375, and associated with his half-brother Gratien in the government of the western part of the empire, is explained by the fact by Pearce, that Valentinian II does not take part in the first emulation of the period 375-378, of which date the most recent pieces of the treasure. Among the solidi and multiples are several unpublished pieces and some minor variations. This treasure, flowing with a ship from Treves, represents, in our opinion, some of the donativa lavished by Gratien on the occasion of the sumptuous fetes celebrated during his decennalia (376/377).","Cabinet des Médailles du Musée d'Histoire et d'Art, Luxembourg; inv.no. 1993-200; private collection"

Both brass coins (possibly including coins of Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Faustina) and minimi were found in 1869 and have been assumed to be part of 1 and the same hoard. The 3 accounts of the range of the first brass gave either Severus Alexander, Gallienus or Maximian as the last emperor represented, and it is now impossible to be certain which account is correct. In 1935, C.H.V. Sutherland examined 105 radiate minims from this hoard. These proved to be exactly similar to the 317 radiate minims which were acquired by Sir Arthur Evans at Bristol some years before, along with 6 regular antoniniani (NC, 1934, 92-103) [no. 804]. Dr. Sutherland therefore concluded that these 317 and 105 radiate minims all came from the Whitchurch hoard. The 6 regular antoniniani may or may not have come from the same find. They were of Victorinus (3) and Tetricus II (3). With the 317 minims, were a rough lump of copper and a piece of sheet metal. The 422 minims copied the following prototypes: Gallic Empire types (249), types of Claudius II (23), miscellaneous types (150).
