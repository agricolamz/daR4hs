The villagers then excavated the area and found a stone vault from which two copper-alloy vessels were recovered, along with between 25,000 and 30,000 silver and billon coins which had placed in a pile close by. One vessel contained jewellery and some gold coins. The second vessel contained approximately 620 denarii. Fillon noted that coins of Gordian III, Philip I, Trajan Decius, Trebonianus Gallus, Volusian, Valerian, Gallienus, Salonina and Postumus represented 9/10ths of the the assemblage. The latest coins of Postumus date to Elmer's 14th issue. The discovery attracted attention and soon other villagers discovered two bronze vessels and the vault in which they had been stored. The hoard was dispersed amongst numerous private collections in 1856. These included Arthur Parenteau de la Voute (250 reverse varieties), O. de Rochebrune, Hanaël Jousseaume, De La Brière, Charvet etc. 23 examples were give to the Sociétè Industrielle d'Angers, 18 to the Sociétè des Antiquaires de l'Ouest.
