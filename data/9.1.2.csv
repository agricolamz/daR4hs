Later, another finder produced 200 more coins from the same hoard and the authorities reported a further 19 coins as coming from the same find. Moreover Jenkins suspected that even more coins from the hoard remained in private hands. The hoard was published by Jenkins (NC 1947), with the following summary: 847 coins (664 denarii and 183 antoniniani). There are several inconsis10cies between Jenkins' catalogue and his summary. The first is that the total number of the coins in the catalogue is 846, not 847. The summary lists 3 denarii for Nerva, but catalogue records only 1. For Septimius Severus, the summary lists 290 coins, but the catalogue includes only 286. The summary lists 78 denarii for Caracalla, the catalogue only has 75. Finally the summary lists no antoniniani for Severus Alexander, but 1 is recorded in the appendix listing coins not examined by the BM. According to the catalogue, the hoard contained therefore 846 (653 denarii and 193 antoniniani).

Both brass coins (possibly including coins of Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Faustina) and minimi were found in 1869 and have been assumed to be part of 1 and the same hoard. The 3 accounts of the range of the first brass gave either Severus Alexander, Gallienus or Maximian as the last emperor represented, and it is now impossible to be certain which account is correct. In 1935, C.H.V. Sutherland examined 105 radiate minims from this hoard. These proved to be exactly similar to the 317 radiate minims which were acquired by Sir Arthur Evans at Bristol some years before, along with 6 regular antoniniani (NC, 1934, 92-103) [no. 804]. Dr. Sutherland therefore concluded that these 317 and 105 radiate minims all came from the Whitchurch hoard. The 6 regular antoniniani may or may not have come from the same find. They were of Victorinus (3) and Tetricus II (3). With the 317 minims, were a rough lump of copper and a piece of sheet metal. The 422 minims copied the following prototypes: Gallic Empire types (249), types of Claudius II (23), miscellaneous types (150).

France,1992,3493,VAISE,81,258,258,45.763,4.8224,"The context of the treasure burying, although partly known, remains problematic : in fact, there are 2 deposits of precious objects, very close to each other but quite distinct, inside caches which were laid under the ground. Should they be attributed to the occupants of the houses from the second half of the 3rd century AD, or to the occupants of the potter's workshop following in the beginning of the 4th century AD? The first deposit gathers together 2 silver bracelets and a group of statuettes in the same metal, more or less fragmentary. 3 of them are fully preserved : 1 Helios dedicated to an emperor's numen, 1 Fortuna with a double horn of plenty and 1 goddess, more enigmatic, carrying a dish with 2 birds inside. The head of a Jupiter and of an amazing personage with 2 outgrowths as an ornament in the hair add to the whole which is completed by a bust-portrait, probably representing an emperor (Gallienus?). The second deposit, locked inside a wooden box, consists of crookery, jewels and coins. The silverware is made up of 1 dish decorated with a Mercure, 2 small trays ornated with reliefs (1 of them just in bronze and silver plated), 4teen spoons and 2 fragmentary cutleries. All these objects belong to well known series in Gaul : their shapes and decoration show that they were made in the 3rd century AD. The set of jewels includes 2 golden bracelets, 2 pairs of golden, emerald, pearl and mol10 glass pendant earrings, 2 bezel rings (1 of them with a nicolo), and 1 coin medallion (Gordian III aureus, AD 238-244). At the bottom of the box, there was a purse with 81 well preserved silver coins - 29 denarii and 52 antoniniani (radiates) - with a chronological curve stretching from Vitellius (AD 69) to the joint reign of Valerian and Gallian (AD 253-260). In fact, there are 2 different sets : 1 with 62 coins, that is to say 19 ""old"" denarii from Vitellius to Commodus, 8 more recent all dated AD 201, 33 antoniniani (radiates) and 1 denarius struck between AD 215 and AD 217 for Caracalla, as well as, 1 denarius of Diadumenian in AD 218; the second set comprises 19 antoniniani (radiates) coins issued between AD 241 and AD 258. 1 can wonder about the precise nature of these deposits. The sculptures found there do not have quite a homogeneous construction ; maybe a kind of Lares altar or objects belonging to a sanctuary, as most of them represent divinities, and 1 at least, the birds’ goddess, seems to have a strong local connotation. The silverware hardly represents more than 2 pounds of metal ; it is therefore difficult to speak of a ""table set"" all the less as the spoons are rather incomplete. The set of jewels, which is more coherent and of good quality but with no exceptional piece, illustrates well the favourite jewels in the well-off classes of Gaul around the middle of the 3rd century AD. Regarding the coins, there are several arguments speaking for a saving, rather than for a reserve currency, which was formerly made (maybe following 2 main payments (donativa) in AD 202 and AD 217/218, and poorly completed by a contribution in antoniniani (radiates) around AD 258-260), a small family inheritance safeguarded for sentimental reasons, maybe 1 generation away.

In the Moselle Towards the end of April 1958, having taken gravel from the bed of the Moselle between Ahn and Machtum, a dredger belonging to the company Hein de Machtum, brought in his load many currencies of Roman gold. They are pieces of: 321 1/2, 1 and 1/2 solidi, struck almost exclusively by the effigies of the emperors Valentinian I, Valens and Gratian, and preserved at the corner of the coin. The coins were discovered scattered in the gravel, especially on the site of the aforementi1d company located at the place called ""Kommert"" near Machtum and the depot of the Bridges and Chaussees located at a place called ""Banzelt"" near Roodt / Syr , where a truck had deposited 2 loads of this ""enriched"" gravel. Several pieces, especially the multiples, had more or less suffered from their passage through the crusher. No trace of a vessel was found, nor any piece of silver or bronze. It is impossible to estimate accurately the number of pieces found, but the information available to us suggests that it must have been more than a hundred. Coins entered private collections or were sold abroad. 2 pieces were acquired by the Cabinet of Medals of the Museum of History and Art, Luxbg. (Nos 24 and 29). The absence in this treasure of the coinage of Valentinian II, raised to the rank of Auguste on November 22, 375, and associated with his half-brother Gratien in the government of the western part of the empire, is explained by the fact by Pearce, that Valentinian II does not take part in the first emulation of the period 375-378, of which date the most recent pieces of the treasure. Among the solidi and multiples are several unpublished pieces and some minor variations. This treasure, flowing with a ship from Treves, represents, in our opinion, some of the donativa lavished by Gratien on the occasion of the sumptuous fetes celebrated during his decennalia (376/377).","Cabinet des Médailles du Musée d'Histoire et d'Art, Luxembourg; inv.no. 1993-200; private collection"
