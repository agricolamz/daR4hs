The set of jewels includes 2 golden bracelets, 2 pairs of golden, emerald, pearl and mol10 glass pendant earrings, 2 bezel rings (1 of them with a nicolo), and 1 coin medallion (Gordian III aureus, AD 238-244). At the bottom of the box, there was a purse with 81 well preserved silver coins - 29 denarii and 52 antoniniani (radiates) - with a chronological curve stretching from Vitellius (AD 69) to the joint reign of Valerian and Gallian (AD 253-260). In fact, there are 2 different sets : 1 with 62 coins, that is to say 19 ""old"" denarii from Vitellius to Commodus, 8 more recent all dated AD 201, 33 antoniniani (radiates) and 1 denarius struck between AD 215 and AD 217 for Caracalla, as well as, 1 denarius of Diadumenian in AD 218; the second set comprises 19 antoniniani (radiates) coins issued between AD 241 and AD 258. 1 can wonder about the precise nature of these deposits. The sculptures found there do not have quite a homogeneous construction ; maybe a kind of Lares altar or objects belonging to a sanctuary, as most of them represent divinities, and 1 at least, the birds’ goddess, seems to have a strong local connotation. The silverware hardly represents more than 2 pounds of metal ; it is therefore difficult to speak of a ""table set"" all the less as the spoons are rather incomplete. The set of jewels, which is more coherent and of good quality but with no exceptional piece, illustrates well the favourite jewels in the well-off classes of Gaul around the middle of the 3rd century AD. Regarding the coins, there are several arguments speaking for a saving, rather than for a reserve currency, which was formerly made (maybe following 2 main payments (donativa) in AD 202 and AD 217/218, and poorly completed by a contribution in antoniniani (radiates) around AD 258-260), a small family inheritance safeguarded for sentimental reasons, maybe 1 generation away.

Later, another finder produced 200 more coins from the same hoard and the authorities reported a further 19 coins as coming from the same find. Moreover Jenkins suspected that even more coins from the hoard remained in private hands. The hoard was published by Jenkins (NC 1947), with the following summary: 847 coins (664 denarii and 183 antoniniani). There are several inconsis10cies between Jenkins' catalogue and his summary. The first is that the total number of the coins in the catalogue is 846, not 847. The summary lists 3 denarii for Nerva, but catalogue records only 1. For Septimius Severus, the summary lists 290 coins, but the catalogue includes only 286. The summary lists 78 denarii for Caracalla, the catalogue only has 75. Finally the summary lists no antoniniani for Severus Alexander, but 1 is recorded in the appendix listing coins not examined by the BM. According to the catalogue, the hoard contained therefore 846 (653 denarii and 193 antoniniani).

In the casket, there was also a large gold ring with which a small pile of 9 silver Roman denarii had fused. Under the ring in the cluster of coins, an iron knife had been found with a bronze ring, which had stuck to its blade when oxidization had taken place. Further finds had been 7 small trilobate iron-tanged arrowheads and 1 bronze bilobate socketed arrowhead dating from the Hellenistic period. Several bronze bracelets were found in the casket, made from thin wire which had collapsed in pieces; an elegant bronze ring; a spring-clasp earring made of poor-quality silver; 2 curved bronze strap buckles with a protruding tongue; a curved strap fas10er with 2 rivets on a rectangular plate, a small bronze ring, a silver buckle, bronze pincers, the fragmentary remains of a bow-shaped fibula with a broad back-plate and a fragment of a thin-walled convex plaque made of bronze.

In the Moselle Towards the end of April 1958, having taken gravel from the bed of the Moselle between Ahn and Machtum, a dredger belonging to the company Hein de Machtum, brought in his load many currencies of Roman gold. They are pieces of: 321 1/2, 1 and 1/2 solidi, struck almost exclusively by the effigies of the emperors Valentinian I, Valens and Gratian, and preserved at the corner of the coin. The coins were discovered scattered in the gravel, especially on the site of the aforementi1d company located at the place called ""Kommert"" near Machtum and the depot of the Bridges and Chaussees located at a place called ""Banzelt"" near Roodt / Syr , where a truck had deposited 2 loads of this ""enriched"" gravel. Several pieces, especially the multiples, had more or less suffered from their passage through the crusher. No trace of a vessel was found, nor any piece of silver or bronze. It is impossible to estimate accurately the number of pieces found, but the information available to us suggests that it must have been more than a hundred. Coins entered private collections or were sold abroad. 2 pieces were acquired by the Cabinet of Medals of the Museum of History and Art, Luxbg. (Nos 24 and 29). The absence in this treasure of the coinage of Valentinian II, raised to the rank of Auguste on November 22, 375, and associated with his half-brother Gratien in the government of the western part of the empire, is explained by the fact by Pearce, that Valentinian II does not take part in the first emulation of the period 375-378, of which date the most recent pieces of the treasure. Among the solidi and multiples are several unpublished pieces and some minor variations. This treasure, flowing with a ship from Treves, represents, in our opinion, some of the donativa lavished by Gratien on the occasion of the sumptuous fetes celebrated during his decennalia (376/377).","Cabinet des Médailles du Musée d'Histoire et d'Art, Luxembourg; inv.no. 1993-200; private collection"

The coins were probably originally contained in a bag. There were approximately 251 loose coins and a conglomerate of perhaps 400 more. The general condition of the coins was very poor - many were totally illegible. It was suggested that the coins may have been originally fused together as a result of fire. This hoard is composed almost entirely of ancient copies to which a few of the very common coins of 330 to 348 were added.
